            SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)
         </p>

         <p>
            Copyright (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald
            S. Karr Copyright (C) 1992 Ronald S. Karr Copyleft
            (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr
         </p>

         <p>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can
            also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.
         </p>

         <p>
            The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
            mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license
            is intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL. To make
            sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make
            restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to
            ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.
         </p>

         <p>
            Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
            away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get
            it if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it
            in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
         </p>

         <p>
            To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid
            you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you
            distribute copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the
            rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive
            or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.
         </p>

         <p>
            Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
            finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL. If SMAIL is
            modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
            know that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any
            problems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.
         </p>

         <p>
            Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr)
            make the following terms which say what you must
            do to be allowed to distribute or change SMAIL.
         </p>

               <p>
                  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source
                  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a valid
                  copyright notice &quot;Copyright (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp;
                  Ronald S. Karr&quot; (or with whatever year is appropriate); keep
                  intact the notices on all files that refer to this License
                  Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give
                  any other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this
                  License Agreement along with the program. You may charge a

                        to some or all third parties, at your option).

                        You may charge a distribution fee for the physical
                        act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
                        offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

                  above provided that you also do one of the following:
               </p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
                  
<li>
                     <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> a)</span></var>

                        accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
                        three years, to give any third party free (except for
                        a nominal shipping charge) a complete machine-readable
                        copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed

                        as to where the corresponding source code may be
                        obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for
                        non-commercial distribution and only if you received
                        the program in object code or executable form alone.)

                  For an executable file, complete source code means all
                  the source code for all modules it contains; but, as
                  a special exception, it need not include source code
                  for modules which are standard libraries that accompany
                  the operating system on which the executable file runs.

                  You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL
                  except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any
                  attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer
                  SMAIL is void and your rights to use the program under this
                  License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However,
                  parties who have received computer software programs from
                  you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses
                  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

                  If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free
                  programs whose distribution conditions are different,
                  write to Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr via the Free

                  rule that can be stated here, but we will often permit
                  this. We will be guided by the two goals of preserving
                  the free status of all derivatives of our free software
                  and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software.

      SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)&#10;&#10;Copyright (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr Copyright (C) 1992 Ronald S. Karr Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr&#10;&#10;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.&#10;&#10;The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.&#10;&#10;Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#10;&#10;To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.&#10;&#10;Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL. If SMAIL is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.&#10;&#10;Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change SMAIL.&#10;&#10;COPYING POLICIES&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;1.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice &quot;Copyright (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr&quot; (or with whatever year is appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program. You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;2.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;   You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;a)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;b)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;c)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#10;&#10;      Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other program under the scope of these terms.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;3.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;   You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;a)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;b)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;c)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;      accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)&#10;&#10;   For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;4.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;   You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;5.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;   If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon Curt Noll &amp; Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often permit this. We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software.&#10;&#10;   Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our software are welcome! This contract was based on the contract made by the Free Software Foundation. Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in general.&#10;&#10;NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL &amp; RONALD S. KARR AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH YOU. SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &amp; RONALD S. KARR AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE SMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.&#10;&#10;
