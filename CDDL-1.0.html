      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                   this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original

            Application of Additional Terms.
              <br />
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that
                   alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos;
                   rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                   However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                   Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
                   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                   warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

            Distribution of Executable Versions.
              <br />
      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
                   License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                   different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                   this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
                   alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
                   in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                   different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                   this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
                   You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                   liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                   such terms You offer.

            Larger Works.
              <br />
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by
                   the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                   a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                   Covered Software.

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new

                   distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than
                   the license steward has the right to modify this License.

            Effect of New Versions.
              <br />
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
                   prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
                   version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
                   the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                   License published by the license steward.

              <br />
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
                   Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                   the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
                   note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                   the license contains terms which differ from this License.

        U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
        <p>The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
           2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; (as that term is
           defined at 48 C.F.R. Â§ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software
           documentation&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
           48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
           End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.

        MISCELLANEOUS.
        <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
           of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
           extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
           jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
           extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&apos;s
           conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
           jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
           contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
           including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses.
           The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
           Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
           contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
           that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
           regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
           distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>

        RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
