			Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
                 whether tort (including negligence), contract,
                 or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
                 who distributes Covered Software as permitted
                 above, be liable to You for any direct,
                 indirect, special, incidental, or
                 consequential damages of any character
                 including, without limitation, damages for
                 lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
                 computer failure or malfunction, or any and
                 all other commercial damages or losses, even
                 if such party shall have been informed of the
                 possibility of such damages. This limitation
                 of liability shall not apply to liability for
                 death or personal injury resulting from such
                 party&apos;s negligence to the extent applicable
                 law prohibits such limitation. Some
                 jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                 limitation of incidental or consequential
                 damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
                 not apply to You.

                 reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
