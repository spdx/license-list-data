               You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to
               others, and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your
               own software, on a world-wide, royalty-free basis. That
               portion of your distribution that does not consist of intact
               and unchanged copies of SOFA source code files is a &quot;derived

                     Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that

                     The source code of your derived work must contain

                  Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software
                  is intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU
                  standards, and consequently third-party modifications
                  are discouraged. All variations, no matter how minor,
                  must be explicitly marked as such, as explained above.

               incidental, or special damages, including any lost profits
