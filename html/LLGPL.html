         <p>
            A &quot;Library&quot; in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and
            foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code
            (for processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the
            result of compilation of source code or built with some other
            mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can
            be linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we
            do so in the most general way to include, in addition, methods
            and unnamed functions. Lisp &quot;data&quot; is also a general term that
            includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp classes.
            A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects
            as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application
            is necessarily a &quot;work based on the Library&quot; it contains.
         </p>

         <p>
            The <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> 
            consists of everything in the distribution file set
            before any modifications are made to the files. If any of the
            functions or classes in the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> 
            are redefined in other files,
            then those redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>. 
            If additional methods are added to generic functions in
            the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>, 
            those additional methods are NOT considered a work
            based on the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>. 
            If <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> classes are subclassed, these
            subclasses are NOT considered a work based on the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>. 
            If the Library is modified to explicitly call other functions that are
            neither part of Lisp itself nor an available add-on module to Lisp,
            then the functions called by the modified 
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> 
            ARE considered a work based on the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>. 
            The goal is to ensure that the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>
            will compile and run without getting undefined function errors.
         </p>

         <p>
            It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the 
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>,
            but it must be done in a way such that the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> 
            will still run without that proprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL
            distinguishes between the case of a library being dynamically linked
            at runtime and one being statically linked at build time. Section
            5 of the LGPL states that the former results in an executable
            that is a &quot;work that uses the Library.&quot; Section 5 of the LGPL
            states that the latter results in one that is a &quot;derivative of the
	    Library&quot;, which is therefore covered by <var class="optional-license-text"> the</var> LGPL. Since Lisp only
            offers one choice, which is to link the Library into an executable
            at build time, we declare that, for the purpose applying the LGPL
            to the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>, 
            an executable that results from linking a &quot;work
            that uses the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>&quot; 
            with the Library is considered a &quot;work
            that uses the Library&quot; and is therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.
         </p>

         <p>
            Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable
            to the <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var>. 
            However, in connection with each distribution of
            this executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the
            terms and conditions of the LGPL, the source code of 
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern Library|AllegroServe Library"> Library</span></var> (or
            your derivative thereof) that is incorporated into this executable.
         </p>
