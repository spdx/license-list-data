Karr\n Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n\n  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\nmercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\nintended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that\nyou get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions\nthat forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\nthe rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n\n  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\naway copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it\nif you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\ndeprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\ncopies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\nfinds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by\nsomeone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\nthey have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on our reputation.\n\n  Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following \nterms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change \nSMAIL.\n\n\n\t\t\tCOPYING POLICIES\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice \"Copyright\n(C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\" (or with whatever year is\nappropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\nLicense Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License\nAgreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee\nfor the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,\nand copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of\nParagraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or\n    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other program under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\nall modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\nsource code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\noperating system on which the executable file runs.\n\n  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL\nexcept as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and\nyour rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be\nautomatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\nsoftware programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon\nCurt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51\nFranklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet\nworked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often\npermit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the\nfree status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software.\n\nYour comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\nsoftware are welcome!

KARR AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH\nYOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &\nRONALD S. KARR AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE\nSMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nLOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\nPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL, EVEN IF YOU HAVE\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY\nANY OTHER PARTY.\n",
