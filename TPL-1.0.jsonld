If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.

If it is not possible\n                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\n                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\n                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or\n                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n                  to the notice described in Exhibit A.

The Source Code version of\nCovered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and\nYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\nCode You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\nthis License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create\nor to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form\nunder the terms of this License either on the same media as an\nExecutable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\navailable to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code to\nwhich You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You\nmade to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must\ninclude a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\nDeveloper and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the\nSource Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\ndocumentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\nCovered Code.\n\n3.4.

If\nContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\navailable as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\nmodify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\nthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\nreceived the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n(b) Contributor APIs.  If Contributor's Modifications include an\napplication programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of\npatent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\nContributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n \n(c) Representations.  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed\npursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that\nContributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)\nand/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\nby this License.\n\n\n3.5. Required Notices.  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in\neach file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such\nnotice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You\nmust include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\nwhere a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\ncreated one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\nduplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where\nYou describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to\nCovered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\nliability terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute Covered\nCode in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5\nhave been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice\nstating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\nunder the terms of this License, including a description of how and\nwhere You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice\nmust be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\nrelated documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\nrights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the\nlicense for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under\na different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms\nwhich differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\nInitial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify\nthe Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\nby the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\nterms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\nCode with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You\nmust make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\nCovered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n6.1. New Versions.  Thomas Richter may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given\na distinguishing version number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.  Once Covered Code has been published\nunder a particular version of the License, You may always continue to\nuse it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use\nsuch Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by Thomas Richter. No one other than Thomas Richter\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created\nunder this License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.  If You create or use a modified version of\nthis License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which\nis not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\nrename Your license so that the phrases \"TPL\", \"THOR Software\",\n\"Thomas Richter\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this\nLicense) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the\nlicense contains terms which differ from the THOR Public\nLicense. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code\nor Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\nthemselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE\nIN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\nOF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\nEXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree\nin writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\"\nand \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are\nused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\nC.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\nall U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\nrights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\nGerman law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\nprovides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With\nrespect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an\nentity chartered or registered to do business in Federal Republic of\nGermany, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Federal Republic of\nGermany, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\nwithout limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\nexpenses.
