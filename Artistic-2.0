      <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
         not allowed.</p>

      <p>Preamble</p>

      <p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified,
         distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
         control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source
         and free software.</p>

      <p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright
         Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
         make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing
         arrangement.</p>

      <p>Definitions</p>

        </li>
        
<li>
            <p>&quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or

<li>
            <p>&quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing

            <p>&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only
         in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>

        </li>
        
<li>
            <p>&quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not
         explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>

        </li>
        
<li>
            <p>&quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the
         Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.</p>

<li>
            <p>&quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (1)</span></var>
          You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any
             purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

</ul>

      <p>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (2)</span></var>
          You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in
             any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you
             duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your
             discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (3)</span></var>
          You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the
             Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as
             such will be subject to the Original License.

</ul>

      <p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</p>

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (4)</span></var>
          You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and
             with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document
             how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
             non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
             following:

              make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under
                 the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the
                 Standard Version.
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (b)</span></var>
              ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or
                 running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
                 different from the name of the Standard Version.

                   Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                   received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works
                   derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
                   Distributor Fees are allowed.

          You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you
             include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such
             instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
             time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
             instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or
             cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are
             invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

          You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other
             packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing
             fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components
             in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution
             of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (8)</span></var>
          You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package
             in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of
             applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided
             the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.&#10;&#10;You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.
