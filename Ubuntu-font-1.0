            -------------------------------
         </p>

         <p>
            PREAMBLE This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used,
            studied, modified and redistributed freely. The fonts,
            including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
            and redistributed provided the terms of this licence are
            met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
            under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain
            under this licence does not require any document created
            using the fonts or their derivatives to be published under
            this licence, as long as the primary purpose of the document
            is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of the fonts.
         </p>

         <p>
            DEFINITIONS &quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of
            files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this
            licence and clearly marked as such. This may include
            source files, build scripts and documentation.
         </p>

         <p>
            &quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font
            Software components as received under this licence.
         </p>

         <p>
            &quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding
            to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole --
            any of the components of the Original Version, by changing
            formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.
         </p>

         <p>
            &quot;Copyright Holder(s)&quot; refers to all individuals and companies
            who have a copyright ownership of the Font Software.
         </p>

         <p>
            &quot;Substantially Changed&quot; refers to Modified Versions
            which can be easily identified as dissimilar to the
            Font Software by users of the Font Software comparing
            the Original Version with the Modified Version.
         </p>

         <p>
            To &quot;Propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification and with
            or without charging a redistribution fee), making available
            to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
         </p>

         <p>
            PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS This licence does not grant any
            rights under trademark law and all such rights are reserved.
         </p>

         <p>
            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
            person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to propagate
            the Font Software, subject to the below conditions:
         </p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 1)</span></var>
               <p>
                  Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above
                  copyright notice and this licence. These can be included
                  either as stand-alone text files, human-readable
                  headers or in the appropriate machine- readable
                  metadata fields within text or binary files as long
                  as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
               </p>

            </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 2)</span></var>
               <p>
                  The font name complies with the following: (a) The Original
                  Version must retain its name, unmodified. (b) Modified
                  Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
                  avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names
                  entirely. (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially
                  Changed must be renamed to both (i) retain the name of the
                  Original Version and (ii) add additional naming elements
                  to distinguish the Modified Version from the Original
                  Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the
                  name of the Original Version, with &quot;derivative X&quot; where X
                  represents the name of the new work, appended to that name.

                  to the Font Software shall not be used to promote,
                  endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except
                  (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to acknowledge
                  the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
                  or (iii) with their explicit written permission.

                  The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part
                  or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
                  licence, and must not be distributed under any other
                  licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
                  licence does not affect any document created using the
                  Font Software, except any version of the Font Software
                  extracted from a document created using the Font
                  Software may only be distributed under this licence.
