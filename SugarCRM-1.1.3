                        Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
                         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
                         an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
                         you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
                         Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
                         became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
                         Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
                         the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
                         maintained by a third party.

                        Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain

                         change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                         indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
                         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
                         related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

                                 API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                                Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s
                                 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
                                 under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
                                 distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
                                 sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such

                                 shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and
                                 shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
                                 calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
                                 obtained.

                                Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
                                 above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s original

                        Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If
                         it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                         then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
                         would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
                         add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
                         this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or
                         ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                         warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                         Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
                         support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                         indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                         terms You offer.

                        Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
                         the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
                         notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
                         of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
                         of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
                         version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating
                         to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
                         rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
                         provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
                         the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source
                         Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
                         version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                         differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
                         Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                         liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
                         You offer.

                        Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
                         by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                         case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
                         Code.

                Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
                <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
                 or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
                 comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
                 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
                 Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>

                Application of this License.
                <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A
                 and to related Covered Code.</p>

                        Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
                         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
                         choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
                         published by SugarCRM. No one other than SugarCRM has the right to modify the terms applicable
                         to Covered Code created under this License.

                        Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
                         in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You
                         must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;SugarCRM&quot;, &quot;SPL&quot; or any confusingly similar
                         phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
                         License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
                         differ from the SugarCRM Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,

                 of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the

                 provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
                 conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
                 of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any

                 reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
                 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
                 which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
                 not apply to this License.</p>

                 and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
                 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
