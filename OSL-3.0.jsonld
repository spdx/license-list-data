The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the\n             Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to\n             modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source\n             Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\n             Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of\n             the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and\n             convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original\n             Work.\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 4)</span></var>\n          Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors\n             to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or\n             promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the\n             Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to\n             Licensor&apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual\n             property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or\n             import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.\n             No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the\n             Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from\n             licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise\n             would have a right to license.\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 5)</span></var>\n          External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or\n             communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work\n             or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed\n             or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a\n             network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any\n             External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under\n             section 1(c).\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 6)</span></var>\n          Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,\n             all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well\n             as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an\n             &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that\n             You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients\n             that You have modified the Original Work.\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 7)</span></var>\n          Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to\n             the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor\n             or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the\n             contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the\n             immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an\n             &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without\n             limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular\n             purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER\n             OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License.

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort\n             (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any\n             indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result\n             of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for\n             loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n             commercial damages or losses.

If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent\n             indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and\n             conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,\n             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of\n             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the\n             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the\n             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by\n             copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect\n             copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or &quot;fair\n             dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any\n             of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in\n             Section 1(c).\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 10)</span></var>\n          Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer\n             exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an\n             action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging\n             that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an\n             action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software\n             or hardware.\n        </li>\n        \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> 11)</span></var>\n          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought\n             only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor\n             conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its\n             conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n             the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside\n             the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and\n             penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction.
