For the sake of this clause, \u201CCompatible Licence\u201D refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee\u2019s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his\/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. \r\n\r\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and\/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and\/or communicate the Work. \r\n\r\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. \r\n\r\n6. Chain of Authorship\r\n\r\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. \r\n\r\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he\/she brings to the Work are owned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. \r\n\r\nEach time You, as a Licensee, receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence. \r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\n\r\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \u201Cbugs\u201D inherent to this type of software development. \r\n\r\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \u201Cas is\u201D basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. \r\n\r\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work. \r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\r\n\r\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. \r\n\r\n9. Additional agreements\r\n\r\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and\/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n10.

Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. \r\n\r\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and\/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission may put into force translations and\/or binding new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable.
