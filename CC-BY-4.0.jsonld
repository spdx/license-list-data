To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n     a.\tAttribution.\n\n          1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n               A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n                    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n                    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n                    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                    iv.\ta notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n               C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n          2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n          3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n          4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n     a.\tfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n\n     b.\tif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n     c.\tYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n     a.\tUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n     c.\tThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\n     a.\tThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n     b.\tWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n          1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n          2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     c.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n     d.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n     e.\tSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n     a.\tThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n     b.\tAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\n     a.\tFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n     b.\tTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n     c.\tNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n     d.\tNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

The following considerations are for\n         informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>\n\n         <p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the\n         public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.\n         Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the\n         license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n         applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly\n         mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern CC-[ \\t\\r\\n\\f]{0,10}licensed\"> </span></var> material, or material\n         used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

If the licensor&apos;s\n         permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or\n         limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only\n         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n         the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have\n         copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that\n         all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n         respect those requests where reasonable. <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern More considerations|More_considerations\"> More considerations</span></var> for the public<var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern :[ \\t\\r\\n\\f]{1,10}wiki\\.creativecommons\\.org/Considerations_for_licensees|\\.\"> : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees</span></var></p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"optional-license-text\"> \n         <p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License</p>\n\n      </div>\n      <p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and\n         conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;).\n         To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed\n         Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\n         such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material\n         available under these terms and conditions.</p>\n\n      <p>Section 1 <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern -{1,2}\"> </span></var> Definitions.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style:none\">\n          \n<li>\n            <var class=\"replaceable-license-text\"><span title=\"can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}\"> a.</span></var>\n            Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from\n               or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,\n               altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission\n               under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.
