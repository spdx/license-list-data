<var class="optional-license-text"> ## </var><var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 1. </span></var>Purpose
          <p>
This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to 
which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your 
private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software 
from liability. 
          </p>

          <p>
This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties 
who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated third party receives any 
part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You 
provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to 
independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss 
of data or capability due to your actions. 
          </p>

          <p>
The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.
          </p>

          <p>
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and 
conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that 
triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow. 
          </p>

              <p>
The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, 
as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by 
You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). 
Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

              <p>
This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You 
show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any 
action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any 
intellectual property right held by Licensor. 
              </p>

              <p>
Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License 
places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the 
intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, 
the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You 
also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party 
beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You 
via specific performance.

          <p>
If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or 
any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made 
available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a &quot;Recipient&quot;), 
either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You 
must comply with the following conditions:

corresponding to the Work (&quot;Access&quot;). 
              </p>

              <p>
The &quot;Source Code&quot; of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making 
modifications, including any comments, configuration information, 
documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds 
or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to 
independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the 
functionality contained in the Work.

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of

Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You 
to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the 
modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either 
a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.</p>

                    <p>
A &quot;Compatible Open Source License&quot; means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

              <p>
In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the 
Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to 
interfere with a Recipient&apos;s ability to fully use an independent copy of the 
Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient&apos;s own User 
Data.

              <p>
&quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, 
where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of 
the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the 
Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or 
where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the 
Recipient.

              <p>
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the 
conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for 
non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will 
automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the 
conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor 
or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible 
for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only 
for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of 
permissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) 
sustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent 
termination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless 
rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, 
either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License 
shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all

judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and

     &quot;User Data&quot; means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.&#10;&#10;

You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;###&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination Due to Litigation&#10;      If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate.
