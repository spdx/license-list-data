         <p>Preamble</p>

         <p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify,
         and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by
         copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the
         European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights,
         too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain
         ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>

         <p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in
         the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not
         the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license
         for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the
         contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what
         rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what
         rights apply.</p>

         <p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not
         addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data
         protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to
         consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.</p>

         <p>------</p>

      </div>

      <p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>

      <p>and</p>

            <p>&quot;Database Right&quot; - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&quot;sui
             generis&quot;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member
             states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part
             of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under
             Section 10.4.</p>

            <p>&quot;Derivative Database&quot; - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes
             any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the
             Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to,
             Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
             Database.</p>

            <p>&quot;Extraction&quot; - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial

             incorporate.</p>

            <p>&quot;Produced Work&quot; - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or
             sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or
             other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a

            Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed
               includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over
               the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law
               varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which
               is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the
               Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names

            Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the
               whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is
               no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are
               removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe
               any applicable copyright; and

             Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
             privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than
             Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example,
             if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over

             for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
             include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
             the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
             known or created in the future.

Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.&#10;&#10;Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.&#10;&#10;Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.&#10;&#10;------&#10;&#10;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&#10;The Licensor (as defined below)&#10;&#10;and&#10;&#10;You (as defined below)&#10;&#10;agree as follows:&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.0&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions of Capitalised Words&#10;   &quot;Collective Database&quot; - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Convey&quot; - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Contents&quot; - The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Database&quot; - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Database Directive&quot; - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Database Right&quot; - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&quot;sui generis&quot;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Derivative Database&quot; - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Extraction&quot; - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.&#10;&#10;   &quot;License&quot; - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Licensor&quot; - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Person&quot; - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Produced Work&quot; - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Publicly&quot; - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).&#10;&#10;   &quot;Re-utilisation&quot; - means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Substantial&quot; - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Use&quot; - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.&#10;&#10;   &quot;You&quot; - Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.&#10;&#10;   Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.0&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; What this License covers&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.1.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Legal effect of this document.

Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details.
