               <p>
                  All Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications, as
                  Source Code or Object Code, must be, as a whole, either
                  under (a) the terms of this License or the ESA-PL Strong
                  Copyleft license v2.4 or (b) any later version of these
                  Licenses unless the Software is expressly Distributed only
                  under a specific version of the License by a Contributor
                  or (c) the terms of a compatible license as listed
                  in Appendix A to this License. Any obligation in this
                  License to Distribute under the terms of this License,
                  in particular as set out in Sec. 3.2, shall be construed
                  as referring to &quot;this License or a compatible license&quot;.

               <p>
                  In the event of the Distribution of a compilation of Software
                  and/or Modifications with other separate and independent works
                  (for example in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
                  medium), which are not by their nature extensions or other
                  modifications of the Software and/or the Modifications,
                  and which are not combined with it such as to form a single
                  larger program, Distribution of the compilation does not cause
                  this License to apply to the other parts of the compilation.

                  not be included as part of the Source Code pursuant
                  to Sec. 3.3. &quot;System Library&quot; means anything that is

                  with the major components (kernel, window system etc.)

                  license terms, provided that the external module and the
                  Software run in separate address spaces, with one calling
                  the other, or each other interfacing, when they are run.

                  provide in addition a copy of the Source Code of the

                  from You, and inform recipients how to obtain a copy of

                  at a minimum in the &quot;NOTICE&quot; file pursuant to Sec. 4.4
                  You are obliged to make the Source Code accessible in
                  accordance with this Section for as long as You continue

                  originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably
                  allows identification and contact with the Contributor.
                  The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text

                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient&apos;s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing

                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such

                  the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.
