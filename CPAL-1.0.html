          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This license is essentially a rebranded version of MPL-1.1, but with some important changes. The added ยง14 includes an advertising clause, and in order for that CPAL-1.0 introduces the concept of an &quot;Original Developer&quot; (&quot;organizer of the development of the Original Code&quot;). The added ยง15 extends the (weak) copyleft also to trigger on network use.</p>

                     Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor
                     Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
                     software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent

                <br />
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                     this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
                     Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
                     version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
                     this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
                     impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
                     version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may
                     include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
                     3.5.

              Availability of Source Code.
                <br />
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
                     Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to
                     whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
                     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
                     the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
                     version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients.
                     You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
                     if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

              Description of Modifications.
                <br />
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
                     changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
                     include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                     indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                     name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Code.

                  Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s
                     intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                     Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                     Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the
                     party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
                     Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described
                     in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                     makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                     mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                     Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming
                     interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
                     to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
                     file.

                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
                     above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are
                     Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                     grant the rights conveyed by this License.

              Required Notices.
                <br />
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
                     possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                     then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a
                     user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                     Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                     Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                     Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to
                     Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
                     You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                     any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
                     or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                <br />
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                     3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
                     the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                     License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
                     of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
                     Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
                     recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
                     Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
                     which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
                     version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source
                     Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
                     Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
                     any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                     Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                     Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                     by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                     such terms You offer.

              Larger Works.
                <br />
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
                     terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                     case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                     Covered Code.

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            <br />
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
                 must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
                 (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
                 distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
                 regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
                 skill to be able to understand it.

              Effect of New Versions.
                <br />
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
                     such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
                     by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms
                     applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

              Derivative Works.
                <br />
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
                     apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must
                     (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Socialtext&quot;,
                     &quot;CPAL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
                     (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
                     clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL.

                     Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to
                     be modifications of this License.)

            <br />
   The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
                 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and
                 &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in
                 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
                 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
                 Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

          MISCELLANEOUS.
            <br />
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
                 disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
                 registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
                 this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
                 Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
                 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
                 and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses. The application of the United
                 Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
                 excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
                 be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            <br />
   As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is
                 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
                 utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer,
                 Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
                 basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
                 liability.

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 13.</span></var>
          MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
            <br />
   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.
                 Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of
                 the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any,
                 specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

              As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code
                 (&quot;Original Developer&quot;), in the hope that its promotional value may help
                 justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original
                 Developer may include in Exhibit B (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) a requirement
                 that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run
                 (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original
                 Developer&apos;s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic
                 user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include
                 display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent
                 with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the
                 end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for
                 access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays
                 such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen,
                 notice at login, an &quot;about&quot; display, or dedicated attribution area on user
                 interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way
                 of meeting this requirement for notice.
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (b)</span></var>
              Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image
                 and a URL (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) and is subject to the Attribution
                 Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient
                 duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer
                 and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties,
                 You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no
                 less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other
                 party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B
                 below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code
                 resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is
                 to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot
                 require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution
                 Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a
                 word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the
                 Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the &quot;Attribution
                 Limits&quot;).

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (c)</span></var>
              If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for
                 You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.

          ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.
          <p>The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the
             Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by
             anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made
             available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of
             license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications
             as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.</p>

If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor.

Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;14.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(a)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code (&quot;Original Developer&quot;), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer&#39;s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an &quot;about&quot; display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(b)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a URL (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the &quot;Attribution Limits&quot;).&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(c)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(d)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;15.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.&#10;   The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.&#10;   &#10;   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;EXHIBIT A.
