      <p>PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
         TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE,
         REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE
         OF THIS LICENSE.</p>

      <p>License Background</p>

      <p>Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source
         development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality,
         growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the
         Program (as defined below) under this License.</p>

      <p>This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program,
         including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.
         Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program,
         to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of
         this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be
         distributed under the terms of this License.</p>

      <p>The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.</p>

                 unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to
                 the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf.
                 Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of

              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
                 publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the
                 avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to
                 any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 2.2</span></var>
              Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable,

                 the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed
                 by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section
                 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and
                 is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
                 modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by
                 each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
                 devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of
                 Contributions made by that Contributor.

              Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
                 forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
                 that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
                 other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
                 brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
                 otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
                 Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
                 needed, if any.

                 they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to
                 physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a
                 Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to
                 a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions
                 on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

              A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not
                 governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                 such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are
                 fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
                 offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other
                 Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance
                 warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may
                 create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
                 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby
                 agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made
                 Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,
                 damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
                 brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
                 or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor
                 in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not
                 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
                 infringement.

              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is
                 required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                 Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled
                 ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One
                 Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at
                 opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
                 detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If
                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall
                 also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter
                 and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                 reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has
                 been obtained.

                 proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in
                 any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor
                 must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
                 reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.4&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.6&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation.
