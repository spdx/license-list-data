          Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
             governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
             Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
             future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
             License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
             terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
             License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document

          Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
             made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic
             Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the
             Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain

             least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
             available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
             remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
             party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the
             location of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of
             the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be
             made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the

              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
                 particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a
                 text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the
                 party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you
                 obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2,
                 You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall
                 take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
                 calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
                 obtained.

              Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
                 control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
                 this information in the LEGAL file.

          Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
             this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&apos; rights
             relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as
             a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
             Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
             as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
             choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
             obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
          <p>However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
             Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
             liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
             Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
             Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

          Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
             the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
             notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
             of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
             of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
             version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating
             to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license
             of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
             compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
             not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the
             rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
             license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
             offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
             indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
             Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
          <p>If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in
             Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.</p>

          Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
             case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
             Code.

      INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
      <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
         or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
         terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that
         prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they
         affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
         statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
         ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for
         review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted

      APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
      <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,
         and to related Covered Code.</p>

            <p>Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to
         the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from
         those contained in this License.</p>

            <p>Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming
         subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms
         from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms
         available.</p>

          Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
             License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
             choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
             published by Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms applicable
             to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.

          Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
             in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE&#10;   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.&#10;&#10;   Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.&#10;&#10;   Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License.
