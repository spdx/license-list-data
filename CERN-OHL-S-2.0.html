      <p>Preamble</p>

      <p>CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).</p>

      <p>The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.</p>

      <p>Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.</p>

      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&#10;Preamble&#10;&#10;CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).&#10;&#10;The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.&#10;&#10;Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Definitions&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.1&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; &#39;Licence&#39; means this CERN-OHL-S.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.2&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; &#39;Compatible Licence&#39; means&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on Conveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You treat the Source in question as being licensed under CERN-OHL-S.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.3&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; &#39;Source&#39; means information such as design materials or digital code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is expressed.
