DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DRAFT LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT\nRELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS.\nCREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND\nDISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n\nLicense\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE\nCOMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY\nCOPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\nAUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE\nBOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\nCONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\n    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along\n    with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent\n    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\n    defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,\n    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,\n    art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the\n    Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for\n    the purpose of this License.\n c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\n    terms of this License.\n d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms\n    of this License.\n f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\n    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to\n    the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\n    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\nrestrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\nthe exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\napplicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\nWork as stated below:\n\n a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective\n    Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the\n    Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission\n    Derivative Works;\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\nmodifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\nmedia and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\nreserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You\n    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this\n    License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly\n    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer\n    or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this\n    License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You\n    may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work\n    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a\n    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above\n    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not\n    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject\n    to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice\n    from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n    Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as\n    requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor\n    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any\n    reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,\n    and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,\n    this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You\n    distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n    perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that\n    alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of\n    the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not\n    distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n    perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control\n    access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this\n    License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated\n    in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart\n    from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor\n    represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after\n    reasonable inquiry:\n     i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the\n        license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the\n        rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any\n        royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\n    ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights,\n        common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute\n        defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third\n        party.\n b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING\n    OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,\n    WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF\n    THE WORK.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,\nAND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM\nBREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO\nYOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\nEXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF\nLICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or\n    entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You\n    under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\n    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of\n    this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\n    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\n    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed\n    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements\n    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor\n    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to\nYou or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including\nwithout limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages\narising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)\nsentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor\nhereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is\nlicensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark \"Creative\nCommons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\nwritten consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance\nwith Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be\npublished on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to\ntime.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.\n";
