Preamble</p>

            <p>
Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence (&quot;CERN OHL&quot;) version 1.1, the Organization wishes to disseminate its hardware designs (as published on http://www.ohwr.org/) as widely as possible, and generally to foster collaboration among public research hardware designers. The CERN OHL is copyright of CERN. Anyone is welcome to use the CERN OHL, in unmodified form only, for the distribution of his own Open Hardware designs. Any other right is reserved.</p>

            <p>

            <p>
&quot;Documentation&quot; means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any other media.</p>

            <p>
&quot;Product&quot; means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Documentation or the modified Documentation.</p>

            <p>
&quot;Licensee&quot; means any natural or legal person exercising rights under this Licence.</p>

            <p>
&quot;Licensor&quot; means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or distributes the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence.</p>

            <p>
A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa.</p>

            <p></p>
