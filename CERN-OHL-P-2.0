      <p>Preamble</p>

      <p>CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN- OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).</p>

      <p>The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.</p>

      <p>Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.</p>
