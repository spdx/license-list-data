      <p>You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are under no obligation to

         misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the
         DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
         open-source development model. You needn&apos;t inform anyone that you&apos;re using DOC software in your
         software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software

      <p>The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for
         Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington

         community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is&apos;&apos; with no warranties whatsoever,

         indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without limitation, lost
         profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is
         with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a
         particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice.

         or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt
         University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special,

      <p>DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University,
         UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction,
         modification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for
         DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is
         Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by
         Congress as &quot;The Energy Policy Act of 2005,&quot; which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules
         for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and
         calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long
         as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.</p>
