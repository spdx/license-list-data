      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
                     of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version
                     of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
                     future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a

                     the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.
                     However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights

                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                     to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
                     after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
                     to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                     remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                     third party.

              Description of Modifications.
                <br />
      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting
                     the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
                     must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                     indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                     name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Code.

                  Third Party Claims.
                    <br />
         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
                         particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                         must include a text file with the source code distribution titled
                         &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
                         sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
                         such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in
                         Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
                         available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
                         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                  Contributor APIs.
                    <br />
         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control
                         patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
                         include this information in the LEGAL file.

                </li>

              Required Notices.
                <br />
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this
                     License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
                     recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
                     Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                     Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
                     file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
                     as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
                     notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
                     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
                     You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                <br />
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                     3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
                     that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
                     this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                     notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                     descr ibe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
                     the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
                     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
                     the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
                     attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version
                     from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
                     version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
                     which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
                     and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
                     Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

              Larger Works.
                <br />
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by
                     the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                     such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
                     the Covered Code.

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            <br />
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply
                 with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
                 file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
                 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.

              New Versions.
                <br />
      Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to

              Effect of New Versions.
                <br />
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
                     use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
                     published by Floris van den Berg
                <br />
      No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to
                     Covered Code created under this License.

              Derivative Works.
                <br />
      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
                     to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),
                     you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;FreeImage&quot;,
                     `FreeImage Public License&quot;, &quot;FIPL&quot;, or any confusingly similar
                     phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                     your version of the license contains terms which differ from the FreeImage Public
                     License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
                     Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed
                     to be modifications of this License.)

            <br />
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),

                 PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE

                 LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
                 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          MISCELLANEOUS.
            <br />
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by Dutch law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
                 disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
                 registered to do business in, the The Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in
                 writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
                 intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with
                 the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this
                 Agreement shall be held in Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to
                 this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Almelo, The
                 Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
                 court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which
                 provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
                 not apply to this License.

          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            <br />
   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for
                 damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
                 on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
                 such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
                 responsibility on an equitable basis.

You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(a)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims.&#10;         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.

If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You descr ibe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Works.&#10;      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#10;   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg&#10;      No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Derivative Works.&#10;      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;FreeImage&quot;, &#96;FreeImage Public License&quot;, &quot;FIPL&quot;, or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#10;   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;9.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#10;   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
