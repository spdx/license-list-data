                 the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
                 You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You
                 may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
                 applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for
                 shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this
                 Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the
                 Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor
                 Version. In the event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to
                 publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of
                 Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your
                 Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation and reference implementation
                 or Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as this license on a
                 royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first customer shipment of Your

              Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If
                 it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                 then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
                 would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
                 add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
                 this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or

                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your
                 version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
                 Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
                 indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
                 the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of
                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

                 form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code,
                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
                 available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                 notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You
                 describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable
                 and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
                 choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source
                 versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                 differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby
                 agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
                 as a result of any such terms You offer.

                 Original Code.
