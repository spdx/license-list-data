         <p>PREAMBLE</p>
         <p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the
         Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
         while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
         customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.</p>
      </optional>

      <p>Definitions:</p>
      <p>"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.</p>
      <p>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.</p>
      <p>"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.</p>
      <p>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.</p>
      <p>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>
      <p>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.</p>

          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain

          You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any

          C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and
             variables defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
             equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior
             of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the
             Package.
