         <p>BSD Protection License
        <br/>February 2002
      </p>

      <optional>
         <p>Preamble
        <br/>--------
      </p>
         <p>The Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") license has proven very effective over the years at
         allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For
         programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is
         arguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used
         wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.</p>
         <p>This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The
         case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the
         rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network
         models).</p>
         <p>With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the
         continued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of
         "GPL-tainted" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and
         given that further work will likely build upon the "tainted" portions, making them difficult
         to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to
         protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such
         "GPL-taint".</p>
         <p>In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly
         closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.
         While under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license,
         if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own
         (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.</p>
         <p>For the above reasons, we put forth this "BSD Protection License": A license designed to retain
         the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both
         non-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that
         freedom.</p>
         <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.</p>

          Scope.
            <br/>This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program. Other
                 activities are outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is
                 not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
                 constitute a work based on the Program.

          Verbatim copies.
            <br/>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you receive it, in any
                 medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                 appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
                 and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
                 copy of this License along with the Program.
