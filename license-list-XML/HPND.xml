      <notes>
    This license has been voluntarily deprecated by its author. Original license submission in 2002 was intended to 
    provide a template distilled from permission notices used in many packages. As per the original notes, "It may 
    be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or
    one that includes a double-disclaimer. That is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a 
    non-OSD-compliant license that matches the pattern."
