                     Contributor, the addition of such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the
                     Covered Patents. It does not apply to any other combinations that include a Modification.

                     must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
                     subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
                     requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the
                     alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
                     alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for
                     example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
                     from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not
                     thereafter be revoked.

                     permission of the Contributor who added the notice.

                     by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to
                     obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior

                     Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government
                     Agency by visiting the following website: <alt match=".+" name="userRegistrationWebsite2">_______________</alt>. Recipient's name and personal

                     original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or

                     do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
                     Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such
                     Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability
                     incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such

                     such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the
                     Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

                    Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
                     any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license
                     from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
                     liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be
                     required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such
                     export license.
