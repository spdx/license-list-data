                  Version with other software or other devices or hardware,
                  unless such combination was an intended use case of the
                  Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library
                  is intended to be used with other software, a satellite
                  navigation software is intended to be used with appropriate

                  Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying
                  prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified
                  and the date of modification and identify itself as the
                  originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably
                  allows identification and contact with the Contributor.
                  The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text
                  file included with the Distribution titled “CHANGELOG”.

                  The Software may include a "NOTICE" text file containing
                  general notices. Any Contributor can create such a
                  NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as
                  an addendum to the original text, provided that such
                  notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

                  warranties of any kind, including without limitation
                  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                  absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement
                  of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory
                  warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception
                  or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

                  consequential damages (including without limitation loss
                  of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability,

                  the Software or the exercise of any rights under this
                  License, even if You have been advised of the possibility
                  of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims,
                  e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception
                  or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

                  While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may
                  choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for
                  charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity,
                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient’s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing
                  that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after
                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such
                  event You should acquire the respective rights or modify
                  the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.

                  alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory
                  patent infringement, then any patent and copyright
                  licenses granted to You under this License for the Software
                  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

                  Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Cologne,
