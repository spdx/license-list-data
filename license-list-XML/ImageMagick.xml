      <notes>
         The ImageMagick license is nearly identical to the Apache-2.0 license. The differences are the title
         and additional preamble, and the omission of the parenthetical "(except as stated in this section)"
         from Section 3.

            <p>Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or
             derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or

          Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
             publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

             irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
             transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
             Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
             their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
             lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
             direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
             License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

            <bullet>4.</bullet>
          Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof

        <list>
               <item>
                  <bullet>a.</bullet>
            You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

               <item>
                  <bullet>b.</bullet>
            You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>c.</bullet>
            You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
               copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

                  <bullet>d.</bullet>
            If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative
               Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
               contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
               of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
               file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
               if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
               Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
               may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
               alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
               additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
           </item>
           </list>
            <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
               different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
               modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
               in this License.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>5.</bullet>

             intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
             terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
             license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>6.</bullet>
          Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
             marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
             in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        <item>
            <bullet>7.</bullet>
          Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
             provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT
             WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
             limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
             FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
             exercise of permissions under this License.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>8.</bullet>
          Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
             negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
             grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
             character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
             (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
             malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
             been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>9.</bullet>
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
             thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
             indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
             in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
             responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
             against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
             liability.
