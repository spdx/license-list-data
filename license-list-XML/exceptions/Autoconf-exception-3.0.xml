      <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
         this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
      <p>This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the
         GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to
         a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright
         holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3
         along with this Exception.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of
         Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's
         choice (including proprietary).</p>

          Definitions.
          <p>"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version
             of Autoconf that is a covered work under this
             License.</p>
            <p>"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means
             all parts of its Covered Code which that version can
             copy from its code (i.e., not from its input file)
             into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and
             non-tracing output.</p>
            <p>"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally
             Copied Code.</p>

          Grant of Additional Permission.
          <p>You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even
             if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms
             of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause
             any Ineligible Code of the version you received to
             become Normally Copied Code of your modified version,
             then you void this Exception for the resulting covered
             work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you
             must remove this Exception in accordance with the
             second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.</p>

          No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
          <p>The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
            presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the
            copyleft requirements of the license of Autoconf.</p>
