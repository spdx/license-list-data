            <p>“Independent Work” means portions of the Derivative Work
             that are not derived from the Program and can

          <list>
               <item>
                  <bullet>1.</bullet>
              You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all
                 portions (including modifications) of the Program
                 included in the Derivative Work (provided that this
                 condition does not apply to Independent Works);
            </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>2.</bullet>
              The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed
                 under the GPL other than the Program;
            </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>3.</bullet>
              You distribute Independent Works subject to a license
                 listed in the section below titled “FOSS License
                 List”;
            </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>4.</bullet>
              You distribute Independent Works in object code or
                 executable form with the complete corresponding
                 machine-readable source code on the same medium and
                 under the same FOSS license applying to the object
                 code or executable forms;
            </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>5.</bullet>
              All works that are aggregated with the Program or the
                 Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are
                 not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work
                 or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered
                 independent and separate works.
