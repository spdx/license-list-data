      <p>## Acceptance</p>

      <p>By using the software, you agree to all of the terms and conditions below.</p>

      <p>## Copyright License</p>

      <p>
        The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide,
        non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute, make
        available, and prepare derivative works of the software, in each case subject to
        the limitations and conditions below.
      </p>

      <p>## Limitations</p>

      <p>
        You may not provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed
        service, where the service provides users with access to any substantial set of
        the features or functionality of the software.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality
        in the software, and you may not remove or obscure any functionality in the
        software that is protected by the license key.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices
        of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor&apos;s trademarks is subject
        to applicable law.
      </p>

      <p>## Patents</p>

      <p>
        The licensor grants you a license, under any patent claims the licensor can
        license, or becomes able to license, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for
        sale, import and have imported the software, in each case subject to the
        limitations and conditions in this license. This license does not cover any
        patent claims that you cause to be infringed by modifications or additions to
        the software. If you or your company make any written claim that the software
        infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for
        the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes
        such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your
        company.
      </p>

      <p>## Notices</p>

      <p>
        You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you
        also gets a copy of these terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you modify the software, you must include in any modified copies of the
        software prominent notices stating that you have modified the software.
      </p>

      <p>## No Other Rights</p>

      <p>
        These terms do not imply any licenses other than those expressly granted in
        these terms.
      </p>

      <p>## Termination</p>

      <p>
        If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is not licensed,
        and your licenses will automatically terminate. If the licensor provides you
        with a notice of your violation, and you cease all violation of this license no
        later than 30 days after you receive that notice, your licenses will be
        reinstated retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such
        reinstatement, any additional violation of these terms will cause your licenses
        to terminate automatically and permanently.
      </p>

      <p>## No Liability</p>

      <p>
        *As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
        condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising
        out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of
        legal claim.*
