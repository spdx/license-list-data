                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
                     right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                     must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL&apos;&apos; which
                     describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
                     recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
                     Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the
                     LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
                     (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                     inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                     also include this information in the LEGAL file.

              Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
                 and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&apos;
                 rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add
                 your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to
                 put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
                 include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would
                 be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                 Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
                 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
                 to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
                 liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
                 if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
                 include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
                 under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
                 fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                 notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
                 recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version
                 of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
                 this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
                 the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s
                 rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
                 distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
                 clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
                 Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
                 and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
                 Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

              Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
                 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
                 In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                 Covered Code.

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            <br />
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply
                 with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
                 file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
                 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.

              Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
                 the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
                 also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the

          MISCELLANEOUS.
          <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
             of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
             extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
             provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
             of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a)
             unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any
             dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
             arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.2.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(a)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &#96;&#96;LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(b)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#10;   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Application of this License.&#10;   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.1.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (&#96;&#96;Netscape&#39;&#39;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.2.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &#96;&#96;Mozilla&#39;&#39;, &#96;&#96;MOZILLAPL&#39;&#39;, &#96;&#96;MOZPL&#39;&#39;, &#96;&#96;Netscape&#39;&#39;, &#96;&#96;NPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#10;   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &#96;&#96;AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;9.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#10;   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
