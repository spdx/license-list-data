         <p>This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under
         the terms of this License to Licensor&apos;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are
         required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code
         of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively
         defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License.
         In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for
         the benefit of everyone.</p>

         <p>Under the terms of this License You may:</p>

<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> b.</span></var>
          Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted by this License, but
             the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
             liability in the event that the Licensed Software doesn&apos;t work properly or causes You any
             injury or damages.

          Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted by this License,
             provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions You Deploy available to all third

             Extensions distinctly from the Licensed Software.

             or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3

             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its
             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted

          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the
             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances
             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the

             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any
             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your
             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.

      Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition to, the licenses
         granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any Modifications, Derivative Works,
         or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute
         are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any
         Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this
         License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You hereby grant to
         Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under those
         intellectual property rights You own or control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,
         create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions
         You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or
         Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with every
         copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any
         Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, or its Extensions that alter or
         restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.

                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its
                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain
                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the
                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                 third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in
                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and
                 distribution involve physical media.

                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&apos;s intellectual property
                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making
                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such
                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall
                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take
                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
                     to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been
                     obtained.

              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the
                 Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe
                 recipients&apos; rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in

                 Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a
                 Contributor to the text file titled &quot;CONTRIB&quot; distributed with the Licensed Software along
                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a
                 particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a
                 location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
                 notice.

                 the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and
                 instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire
                 updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised
                 instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify
                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,
                 mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index

                 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so
                 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make
                 it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by

              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being
                 Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another
                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your

      Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of
         the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
         choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
         published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable
         to Licensed Software created under this License.

      Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for
         claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
         this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.
         This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
         Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
         use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties
         and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and
         Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms
         of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
         to constitute any admission of liability.

      Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the
         event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or
         restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or

             thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software

          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a
             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to
             herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any
             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of
             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the
             &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed
             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty
             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and

             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under
             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
             or license.

             license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly
