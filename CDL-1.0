        <p>The Common Documentation License (CDL) provides a very simple and consistent license that allows relatively unrestricted use and redistribution of documents while still maintaining the author&apos;s credit and intent. To preserve simplicity, the License does not specify in detail how (e.g. font size) or where (e.g. title page, etc.) the author should be credited. To preserve consistency, changes to the CDL are not allowed and all derivatives of CDL documents are required to remain under the CDL. Together, these constraints enable third parties to easily and safely reuse CDL documents, making the CDL ideal for authors who desire a wide distribution of their work. However, this means the CDL does not allow authors to restrict precisely how their work is used or represented, making it inappropriate for those desiring more finely-grained control.</p>

        <p>Subject to all the terms and conditions of this License, You may use, copy, modify, publicly display, distribute and publish the Document and your Derivative Works thereof, in any medium physical or electronic, commercially or non-commercially; provided that: (a) all copyright notices in the Document are preserved; (b) a copy of this License, or an incorporation of it by reference in proper form as indicated in Exhibit A below, is included in a conspicuous location in all copies such that it would be reasonably viewed by the recipient of the Document; and (c) You add no other terms or conditions to those of this License.</p>
</li>

        <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 3.</span></var>Derivative Works.
        <p>All Derivative Works are subject to the terms of this License. You may copy and distribute a Derivative Work of the Document under the conditions of Section 2 above, provided that You release the Derivative Work under the exact, verbatim terms of this License (i.e., the Derivative Work is licensed as a &quot;Document&quot; under the terms of this License). In addition, Derivative Works of Documents must meet the following requirements:</p>

<li>
        <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 4.</span></var>Compilation with Independent Works.
        <p>You may compile or combine a Document or its Derivative Works with other separate and independent documents or works to create a compilation work (&quot;Compilation&quot;). If included in a Compilation, the Document or Derivative Work thereof must still be provided under the terms of this License, and the Compilation shall contain (a) a notice specifying the inclusion of the Document and/or Derivative Work and the fact that it is subject to the terms of this License, and (b) either a copy of the License or an incorporation by reference in proper form (as indicated in Exhibit A). Mere aggregation of a Document or Derivative Work with other documents or works on the same storage or distribution medium (e.g. a CD-ROM) will not cause this License to apply to those other works.</p>

        <p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms.

This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.</p>
