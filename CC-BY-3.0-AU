In this clause 4C, &quot;moral rights&quot; means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;5.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;a.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work &quot;as-is&quot; and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise.
