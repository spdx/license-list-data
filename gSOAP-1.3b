                         indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                         name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or

                                Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s
                                 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                                 Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                                 Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party
                                 making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
                                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described
                                 in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                                 makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                                 mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                                 Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                                Contributor APIs. If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming
                                 interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
                                 to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
                                 file.

                        Required Notices.
                        <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
                         possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                         then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a
                         user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                         Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                         Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                         Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to
                         Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
                         You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                         any Contributor.</p>

                        Distribution of Executable Versions.
                        <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                         3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version
                         of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
                         terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
                         of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                         limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                         set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
                         License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If
                         you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you
                         must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials
                         provided with the product.</p>

                         terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                         case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                         Covered Code.</p>

                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
                 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
                 Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(a)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(b)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs.

If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.&#10;      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.8.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Restrictions.&#10;      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.&#10;   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.&#10;   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.1.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; New Versions.&#10;      Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.
