            B.V. (&quot;Licensor&quot;). Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant
            to this License is a &quot;Licensed Product.&quot; Licensed Product,
            in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law.
            This License identifies the terms under which you may use,

               This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English,
               the nature and scope of this License. However, this
               Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect
               of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the
               License and not this Preamble. This License complies with
               the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open
               Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License

                  You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product,
                  alone or as a component of an aggregate software
                  distribution containing programs from several
                  different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

                  Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed
                  Product, including Modifications made by previous
                  Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms
                  &quot;Licensed Product,&quot; &quot;Modifications,&quot; &quot;Contributors&quot;
                  and &quot;Source Code&quot; are defined in the License.)

                  You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed
                  Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it.
                  (The term &quot;Derivative Works&quot; is defined in the License.)

<li>

                  By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of
                  this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to
                  the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by
                  the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make
                  the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.

                  You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose,
                  but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty
                  whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability
                  in the event that the Licensed Product doesn&apos;t
                  work properly or causes you any injury or damages.

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 6.</span></var>
                  If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative
                  Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support,
                  or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to
                  your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.

                  If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor
                  relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach
                  any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed
                  Product under this License automatically terminate.
               </li>
            
</ul>
            <p>
               You may use this License to distribute your own
               Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of
               this License will apply to your Derivative Works
               just as they do to the original Licensed Product.
            </p>

            <p>
               Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works
               under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under
               a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license
               other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill
               the requirements of this License (including the provisions
               relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions
               of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed
               Product, including the files containing Modifications.
            </p>

            <p>
               New versions of this License may be published from time to time.
               You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this
               version of the License or those from the new version. However,
               only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms
               as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on
               precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined
               when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated
               for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

               Exclusions From License Grant.
               <p>
                  Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights
                  to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
                  other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor
                  except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is
                  granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you
                  delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the
                  Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is
                  granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even
                  if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing
                  in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
                  from licensing under different terms from this License any
                  code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

                     Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an
                     express condition for your use of the Licensed Product,
                     you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create
                     or to which you contribute, and which you distribute,
                     are governed by the terms of this License including,
                     without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that
                     you create or to which you contribute may be distributed
                     only under the terms of this License or a future version
                     of this License released under Section 7. You must
                     include a copy of this License with every copy of the
                     Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer
                     or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable
                     version of the Licensed Product or Modifications
                     that alter or restrict the applicable version of this
                     License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However,
                     you may include an additional document offering
                     the additional rights described in Section 4(e).

                     Availability of Source Code. You must make available,
                     under the terms of this License, the Source Code of
                     the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you
                     distribute, either on the same media as you distribute
                     any executable or other form of the Licensed Product,
                     or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software
                     development community for the electronic transfer of data
                     (an &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot;). The Source Code
                     for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that
                     you distribute must remain available for at least twelve
                     (12) months after the date it initially became available,
                     or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
                     of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made
                     available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source
                     Code version remains available even if the Electronic
                     Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

                     Description of Modifications. You must cause any
                     Modifications that you create or to which you contribute,
                     and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting
                     the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or
                     contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any
                     such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a
                     prominent statement that the Modifications are derived,
                     directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and
                     include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor
                     to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii)
                     in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed
                     Product you distribute or in related documentation

                           Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a
                           license to a third party&apos;s intellectual property
                           right is required to exercise the rights granted
                           by this License, you must include a text file with
                           the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that
                           describes the claim and the party making the claim
                           in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
                           to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you
                           make any Modifications available as described in
                           Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL
                           file in all copies you make available thereafter and
                           shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                           mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
                           to inform those who received the Licensed Product

                           Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include
                           an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and
                           you have knowledge of patent licenses that are
                           reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must
                           also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                           that any Modifications you distribute are your
                           original creations and that you have sufficient
                           rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

                     Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any
                     documentation you provide along with the Source Code of
                     any Modifications you create or to which you contribute,
                     and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients&apos;
                     rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate
                     the notice contained in Exhibit A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each
                     file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of
                     the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you
                     may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
                     is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source
                     Code file due to its structure, then you must include such
                     Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file)
                     where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
                     You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,
                     support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
                     recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so
                     only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor
                     or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
                     offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify
                     the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
                     incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

                     Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
                     Licensed Product as an executable program under a license
                     of your choice that may contain terms different from this

                     of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution,
                     (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable
                     version, related documentation and collateral materials
                     stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed
                     Product is available under the terms of this License,
                     including a description of how and where you have fulfilled
                     the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all
                     existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and
                     (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this
                     License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any
                     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and
                     every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor
                     or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.

                     Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create
                     Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or
                     all of the Licensed Product with other code) and

                     any other license you select, with the proviso that
                     the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
                     those portions of the Derivative Works that consist
                     of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

               Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
               <p>
                  If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the
                  terms of this License with respect to some or all of
                  the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or
                  regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of
                  this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the
                  statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to
                  the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the
                  code they affect. Such description must be included in the
                  LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included
                  with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
                  extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
                  must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
                  skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.

                     Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been
                     published under a particular version of the License,
                     you may always continue to use it under the terms of
                     that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed
                     Product under the terms of any subsequent version of
                     the License published by Licensor. No one other than
                     Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms applicable
                     to Licensed Product created under this License.

                     Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you

                     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
                     Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against

                     Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a
                     patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging
                     that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes
                     any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
                     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
                     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
                     the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections
                     1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining

If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.&#10;&#10;New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.&#10;&#10;License Terms&#10;&#10;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Grant of License From Licensor.&#10;   Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as an executable program. &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable program, or a list of differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor.&#10;   &quot;Modifications&quot; means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product.

By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a &quot;Contributor&quot;) hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Exclusions From License Grant.&#10;   Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein.

No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot;). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;d.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;i.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party&#39;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;ii.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;iii.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;e.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients&#39; rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;f.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;g.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#10;   If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Application of This License.&#10;   This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Versions of This License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;d.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;8.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty.&#10;   LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;9.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;d.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;10.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability.&#10;   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;s NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;11.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Responsibility for Claims.&#10;   As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;12.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; U.S. Government End Users.&#10;   The Licensed Product is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;13.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous.&#10;   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;14.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License.&#10;   &quot;You&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7.
