   <<var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}">> You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others, and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software, on a world-wide, royalty-free basis. That portion of your distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply with the following requirements:
      <<var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}">> Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from software provided by SOFA under license to you; and (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or endorsed by SOFA.

      <<var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}">> The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote the original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
      <<var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}">> These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have granted a further right to modify the source code of your derived work.
   Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards, and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged. All variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as such, as explained above.
