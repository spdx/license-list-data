            number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
            themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a

            or of the Work and other pre-existing works protected by copyright, or that is an
            adaptation of a Work that is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.
            Derivative Works include a translation, musical arrangement, dramatisation,
            motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
            or any other form in which a work may be adapted, except that a
            work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
            musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
            with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative Work for

              You may publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this

              public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform or publicly digitally
              perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that exclude, alter or
              restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted

              Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
              made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon
              notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
              Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create
              a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
              practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section
              4(b), as requested.

              If you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display,
              publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
              Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. You must
              also give clear and reasonably prominent credit to (i) the Original Author (by name
              or pseudonym if applicable), if the name or pseudonym is supplied; and (ii) if

              reasonable means associated with the Work, such party or parties. If applicable,
              that credit must be given in the particular way made known by the Original Author
              and otherwise as reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing, by
              conveying the identity of the Original Author and the other designated party or
              parties (if applicable); the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
              practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
              associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
              licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit

If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. You must also give clear and reasonably prominent credit to (i) the Original Author (by name or pseudonym if applicable), if the name or pseudonym is supplied; and (ii) if another party or parties (eg a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) is designated for attribution in the copyright notice, terms of service or other reasonable means associated with the Work, such party or parties. If applicable, that credit must be given in the particular way made known by the Original Author and otherwise as reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing, by conveying the identity of the Original Author and the other designated party or parties (if applicable); the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; False attribution prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if You publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works in accordance with this Licence, You must not falsely attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;d.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Prejudice to honour or reputation prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must not do anything that results in a material distortion of, the mutilation of, or a material alteration to, the Work that is prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honour or reputation, and You must not do anything else in relation to the Work that is prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honour or reputation.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer.&#10;   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENCE OR OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, AND TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK &quot;AS-IS&quot; AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK, OR OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation on Liability.&#10;   TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM CONTRARY MUTUAL AGREEMENT AS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR OPERATION TIME, LOSS, DAMAGE OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR RECORDS; OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OPPORTUNITY, REVENUE, PROFIT OR GOODWILL, OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS; OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;   If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor&#39;s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:&#10;      &#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;i.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;ii.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the repair of the goods;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;iii.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;iv.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; in the case of services:&#10;      &#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;i.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the supplying of the services again; or&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;ii.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.
