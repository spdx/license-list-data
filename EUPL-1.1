                 include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she
                 distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
                 prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.</p>

                <p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or
                 Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
                 done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original
                 Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming

                 Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>

                <p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies
                 thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible
                 Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible
                 Licence. For the sake of this clause, &quot;Compatible Licence,&quot; refers to the licences listed in
                 the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&apos;s obligations under the Compatible
                 Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
                 Compatible Licence shall prevail.</p>

                <p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
                 will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
                 Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute

                <p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the
                 Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of

                 damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or
                 any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
                 damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far
                 such laws apply to the Work.</p>

                Additional agreements
                <p>While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an
                 additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                 indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence.
                 However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
                 responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if
                 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
                 by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such

                <p>The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this

It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot; inherent to this type of software development.&#10;&#10;   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.&#10;&#10;   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;8.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Liability&#10;   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;10.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance of the Licence&#10;   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;13.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous&#10;   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.&#10;&#10;   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole.

Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;14.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Jurisdiction&#10;   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.&#10;&#10;   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;15.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Applicable Law&#10;   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.&#10;&#10;   This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.&#10;Appendix&#10;&#10;&quot;Compatible Licences&quot; according to article 5 EUPL are:&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Common Public License v. 1.0&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Eclipse Public License v. 1.0&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;-&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Cecill v. 2.0
