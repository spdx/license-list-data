             designed to improve or expand the performance and scope of the Software (collectively
             &quot;Contributions&quot;). Per the terms of this License You are free to modify the Software and those
             modifications would belong to You. You may however wish to donate Your Contributions to SCEA
             for consideration for inclusion into the Software. For the avoidance of doubt, if You elect to
             send Your Contributions to SCEA, You are doing so voluntarily and are giving the Contributions
             to SCEA and its parent company Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc., free of charge, to use,

             Contributions into the Software, it shall do so at its own risk and may elect to give credit
             or special thanks to any such contributors in the attached copyright notice. However, if any
             of Your contributions are included into the Software, they will become part of the Software
             and will be distributed under the terms and conditions of this License. Further, if Your
             donated Contributions are integrated into the Software then Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.
             shall become the copyright owner of the Software now containing Your contributions and SCEA
             would be the Licensor.</p>
