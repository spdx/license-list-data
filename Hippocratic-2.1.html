        <p>Permission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this license (&quot;License&quot;), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor&apos;s rights under applicable copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the &quot;Licensee&quot;) obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to do everything with the Software that would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor&apos;s copyright in the Software or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the Licensor can license or becomes able to license, subject to all of the following terms and conditions:</p>

For clarity, although Licensee is free to create modifications of the Software and distribute only the modified portion created by Licensee with additional or different terms, the portion of the Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to this License. If anyone notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has not complied with this Notice section, Licensee can keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee&apos;s License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately.
