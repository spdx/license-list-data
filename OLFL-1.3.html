            <p>However, said patent license shall cover only those rights deriving from the
            patents of the respective Contributors which are indispensable in order not to
            infringe that patent and only to the extent that the use of the Contributor&apos;s
            respective Contributions, whether alone or in combination with other
            Contributions of the Contributors or any third parties together with the Subject
            Matter of the License for which these Contributions were submitted, would
            otherwise infringe that patent. The grant of license shall not include rights
            deriving from the patents which may in future become necessary for their lawful
            use due to subsequent modifications to the Subject Matter or Contributions made
            by third parties after the original submission.</p>

            In the event that You institute patent litigation against any entity or person
            (including a counterclaim or countersuit in a legal action), alleging that the
            Subject Matter of the License or a Contribution incorporated or contained
            therein constitutes patent infringement or indirect infringement, all patent
            licenses which have been granted to You under this License for the Subject
            Matter of the License as well as this License itself shall be deemed terminated
            as of the date on which the action is filed.
