                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> c)</span></var>
            to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public,

          Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
             sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are
             embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
             to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative
             Works.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 3)</span></var>
          Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the
             Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to
             modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
             Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
             Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of
             the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
             convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
             Work.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 4)</span></var>
          Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors
             to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
             promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the
             Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
             Licensor&apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
             property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or
             import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
             No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the
             Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
             licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
             would have a right to license.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 5)</span></var>
          External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or
             communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work
             or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed
             or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a
             network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
             External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under
             section 1(c).
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 6)</span></var>
          Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
             all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well
             as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
             &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that
             You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients
             that You have modified the Original Work.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 7)</span></var>
          Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this
             License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
             including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
             for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
             This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the
             Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 8)</span></var>
          Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort
             (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages
             for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
             commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent
             applicable law prohibits such limitation.

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 9)</span></var>
          Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent
             indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
             conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
             You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
             recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the
             activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
             Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by
             copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
             copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or &quot;fair
             dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of
             the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
             1(c).
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 10)</span></var>
          Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
             exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
             action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
             that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
             action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
             or hardware.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 11)</span></var>
          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought
             only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
             conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
             conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
             the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside
             the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
             penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall
             survive the termination of this License.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 12)</span></var>
          Attorneys&apos; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages
             relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
             including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred in
             connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive
             the termination of this License.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 13)</span></var>
          Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
             be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> 14)</span></var>

          Modification of This License. This License is Copyright Â© 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is
             granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
             License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative
             Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate
             your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and apply it to other original works
             of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that
             your Modified License is the &quot;Open Software License&quot; or &quot;OSL&quot; and you may
             not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice
             specified in the first paragraph above with the notice &quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your
             license name here&gt;&quot; or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to
             the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
             source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI)
             and You comply with its license review and certification process.
