              Application of License.
              <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
                 License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
                 be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
                 released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
                 Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
                 that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights
                 hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
                 described in Section 3.5.</p>

              Availability of Source Code.
              <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source
                 Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or
                 via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable
                 version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
                 available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
                 least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
                 available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                 remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
                 party.</p>

              Description of Modifications.
              <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes
                 You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
                 statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
                 provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
                 Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which

                Third Party Claims.
                <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual property
                   rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1
                   or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
                   &quot;LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
                   sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
                   knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                   Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
                   thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
                   newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
                   knowledge has been obtained.</p>

                   Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
                   that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>

                Representations.
                <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
                   Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s original
                   creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this

              Required Notices.
              <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
                 to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
                 include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
                 to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
                 a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in
                 any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership
                 rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
                 support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
                 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                 any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity
                 or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                 Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
                 Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
              <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5
                 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
                 version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
                 description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
                 must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation
                 or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You
                 may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of
                 Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
                 not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the
                 rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
                 offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
                 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>

              Larger Works.
              <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms
                 of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
                 make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
          <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
             comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>

              Effect of New Versions.
              <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always
                 continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered
                 Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Interbase. No one
                 other than Interbase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created

              Origin of the Interbase Public License.
              <p>The Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes:
                <br />
      The license is published by Borland Software Corporation. Only Borland Software Corporation
                     can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.
                <br />
      The license can be modified used for code which is not already governed by this license.
                     Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or
                     Interbase Software?s license and must include a description of changes from the
                     Interbase Public License.
                <br />
      The name of the license in Exhibit A is the &quot;Interbase Public License&quot;.
                <br />
      The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
                <br />
      Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
                <br />
      Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted
                <br />
      A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and restricted rights to use
                     the trademarks of Borland Software Corporation
              </p>
