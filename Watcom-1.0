                         provided that such license agreement contains terms no less protective of Sybase and each
                         Contributor than the terms of this License, and stating that any provisions which differ from
                         this License are offered by You alone and not by any other party.

                 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each Contributor grants the licenses
                    to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided
                    by Sybase or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
                    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each Contributor disclaim any
                    liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
                    property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
                    hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
                    rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You
                    to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before
                    distributing the Covered Code.

             Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this
                License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free
                license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other
                than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify,
                distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Sybase&apos;s licenses
                under Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

             Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
                by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such
                instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
                Code or any portion thereof.

             Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights,
                express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may
                require additional patent licenses from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole

             Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
                or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with this License (&quot;Additional Terms&quot;)
                to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and
                as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. You must obtain
                the recipient&apos;s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You
                hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any
                liability incurred by or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any
                such Additional Terms.

             Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
                to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has
                been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under
                the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of
                any subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No one other than Sybase has the
                right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

             NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested,
                or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or
                loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and

                THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND

                EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
                MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF
                QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES
                NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS
                CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED
                CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE
                CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED
                REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered
                Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation,
                communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the
                Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
                damage.

             LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SYBASE OR ANY
                CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER
                DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE

                (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
                HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
                ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
                TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase&apos;s or any Contributor&apos;s total liability to You for all damages
                (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five
                hundred dollars ($500.00).

             Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names &quot;Sybase&quot;
                or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Sybase (collectively &quot;Sybase Marks&quot;) or to

                or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code

             Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all

                 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as defined in FAR 2.101. Government
                    software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily
                    provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in
                    technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and
                    12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015

                    Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
                    Code with only those rights set forth herein.

                 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
                    joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among you, Sybase or any
                    Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,

                 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase&apos;s or any Contributor&apos;s right
                    to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology
                    or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,

                 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this
                    License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any
                    law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
                    the drafter will not apply to this License.

                 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
                    License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of
                    the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
                    specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of
                    those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue
                    any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or
