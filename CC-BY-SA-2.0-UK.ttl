Further licence from You\n\nEach time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate\n\n    * a Derivative Work; or\n\n    * a Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work\n\nYou agree to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (in either of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Derivative Work on any of the following premises:\n\n    * a licence to the Derivative Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You hereunder; or\n\n    * a later version of the licence granted to You hereunder; or\n\n    * any other Creative Commons licence with the same Licence Elements.\n\n2.4. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.\n\n2.5. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to, the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a licensing body, such as a collecting society, royalties for any use of the Work which results in commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.\n\n3.

Termination\n\nThe rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.

These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be otherwise available upon request from time to time.\n\n7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence.\n\n7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.\n\n7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.\n\n7.5.

Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.\n";
