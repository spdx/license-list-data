	  competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its business,
	  in whatever way it chooses.
	  No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products or services.

	      Contributor and Licensee represents and warrants that
	      1) it is legally entitled to grant the rights set forth in this License and
	      2) it will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution
	      unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this License.
	      IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot;
	      The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution
	      or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user.
	      Except as stated herein, CONTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES
	      (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
	      NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITIONS OF QUALITY,
	      OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION.
	      IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS
	      OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
	      FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT,
	      WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE,

	      Any obligations regarding the transfer, successors in interest,
	      or assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied
	      if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee or assignee of any patent
	      that it knows contains Necessary Claims or necessary claims under this License.
	      Nothing in this License requires Contributor to undertake a patent search.
	      If Contributor is 1) employed by or acting on behalf of an employer,
	      2) is making a Contribution under the direction or control of a third party, or
	      3) is making the Contribution as a consultant, contractor,
	      or under another similar relationship with a third party,
	      Contributor represents that they have been authorized by that party
	      to enter into this License on its behalf.
