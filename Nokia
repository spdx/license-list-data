   The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
                     of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version
                     of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
                     future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
                     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
                     not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
                     the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.
                     However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
                     described in Section 3.5.

              Availability of Source Code.
                <br />
   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
                     Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                     to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
                     after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
                     to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                     remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                     third party.

              Description of Modifications.
                <br />
   You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
                     documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of
                     any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
                     derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and
                     including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Software.

                  Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                     party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
                     by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim
                     and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
                     contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                     available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL
                     file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                     (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                     inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been
                     obtained.

                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming
                     interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                     necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
                     LEGAL file.

                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                     3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are
                     Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                     grant the rights conveyed by this License.

              Required Notices.
                <br />
   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
                     not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
                     structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
                     directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
                     one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
                     described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                     for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights
                     relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
                     Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                     behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                     such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
                     and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability
                     incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
                     or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                <br />
   You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of
                     Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a
                     notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available
                     under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
                     fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
                     included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                     collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered
                     Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or
                     ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
                     from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
                     License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
                     or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                     set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
                     different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                     from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You
                     hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                     by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

              Larger Works.
                <br />
   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not
                     governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
                     product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
                     fulfilled for the Covered Software.

          INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
            <br />
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then
                 You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
                 and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
                 distributions of the Source Code.

          <p>Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
             detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>

              New Versions.
                <br />
   Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each

              Effect of New Versions.
                <br />
   Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You
                     may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose
                     to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                     License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the
                     terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License.

             place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found
             void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which
             shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.</p>

             As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly
             or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia
             and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
             or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor.

You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.7&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Works.&#10;   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
