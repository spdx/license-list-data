materials. Contributor also acknowledges that the Working Group may
exercise copyright rights in the Specification, including the rights to
submit the Specification to another standards organization.

1.2. Copyright Attribution. As a condition, anyone exercising this
copyright license must include attribution to the Working Group in any
derivative work based on materials developed by the Working Group.
That attribution must include, at minimum, the material’s name,

Attribution is not required for implementations of the Specification.

2. Patents.

2.1. Patent License.

2.1.1. As a Result of Contributions.

2.1.1.1. As a Result of Contributions to Draft Specifications.
Contributor grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
expressly stated in this License) license to its Necessary Claims in 1)
Contributor’s Contributions and 2) to the Draft Specification that
is within Scope as of the date of that Contribution, in both cases for
Licensee’s Implementation of the Draft Specification, except for those
patent claims excluded by Contributor under Section 3.

2.1.1.2. For Approved Specifications. Contributor grants Licensee a
non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License)

Specification, except for those patent claims excluded by Contributor
under Section 3.

2.1.2. Patent Grant from Licensee. Licensee grants each other Licensee
a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License)
license to its Necessary Claims for its Implementation, except for those
patent claims excluded under Section 3.

2.1.3. Licensee Acceptance. The patent grants set forth in Section 2.1
extend only to Licensees that have indicated their agreement to this
License as follows:

2.1.3.1. Source Code Distributions. For distribution in source code,
by including this License in the root directory of the source code with
the Implementation;

2.1.3.2. Non-Source Code Distributions. For distribution in any form
other than source code, by including this License in the documentation,
legal notices, via notice in the software, and/or other written materials
provided with the Implementation; or

2.1.3.3. Via Notices.md. By issuing pull request or commit to the
Specification’s repository’s Notices.md file by the Implementer’s
authorized representative, including the Implementer’s name, authorized
individual and system identifier, and Specification version.

2.1.4. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee files or maintains a
claim in a court asserting that a Necessary Claim is infringed by an
Implementation, any licenses granted under this License to the Licensee
are immediately terminated unless 1) that claim is directly in response
to a claim against Licensee regarding an Implementation, or 2) that claim
was brought to enforce the terms of this License, including intervention
in a third-party action by a Licensee.

2.1.5. Additional Conditions. This License is not an assurance (i)
that any of Contributor’s copyrights or issued patent claims cover
an Implementation of the Specification or are enforceable or (ii) that
an Implementation of the Specification would not infringe intellectual
property rights of any third party.

2.2. Patent Licensing Commitment. In addition to the rights granted
in Section 2.1, Contributor agrees to grant everyone a no charge,
royalty-free license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
to Contributor’s Necessary Claims that are within Scope for:
1) Implementations of a Draft Specification, where such license
applies only to those Necessary Claims infringed by implementing
Contributor's Contribution(s) included in that Draft Specification,
and 2) Implementations of the Approved Specification.

This patent licensing commitment does not apply to those claims subject
to Contributor’s Exclusion Notice under Section 3.

2.3. Effect of Withdrawal. Contributor may withdraw from the Working Group
by issuing a pull request or commit providing notice of withdrawal to
the Working Group repository’s Notices.md file. All of Contributor’s
existing commitments and obligations with respect to the Working Group

new obligations will be incurred.

2.4. Binding Encumbrance. This License is binding on any future owner,
assignee, or party who has been given the right to enforce any Necessary
Claims against third parties.

3. Patent Exclusion.

3.1. As a Result of Contributions. Contributor may exclude Necessary
Claims from its licensing commitments incurred under Section 2.1.1
by issuing an Exclusion Notice within 45 days of the date of that
Contribution. Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for any
material that has been included in a Draft Deliverable for more than 45
days prior to the date of that Contribution.

3.2. As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved
Specification. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an
Approved Specification, Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from
its licensing commitments under this Agreement by issuing an Exclusion
Notice. Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents that
were eligible to have been excluded pursuant to Section 3.1.

4. Source Code License. Any source code developed by the Working Group is
solely subject the source code license included in the Working Group’s
repository for that code. If no source code license is included, the
source code will be subject to the MIT License.

granted under this License, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.

6. Antitrust Compliance. Contributor acknowledge that it may compete
with other participants in various lines of business and that it is
therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives
act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and
regulations. This License does not restrict any Contributor from engaging
in similar specification development projects. Each Contributor may
design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables,
products, and services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it
chooses. No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products
or services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any product
pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets,
allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed
among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group.

7. Non-Circumvention. Contributor agrees that it will not intentionally
take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the
purpose of circumventing any obligations under this License.

8.1. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. Contributor and Licensee
represents and warrants that 1) it is legally entitled to grant the
rights set forth in this License and 2) it will not intentionally include
any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are
available under terms that do not conflict with this License. IN ALL OTHER
RESPECTS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." The entire risk as to
implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification
is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein,
CONTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES (EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITIONS OF QUALITY,
OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION. IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY
FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Any obligations regarding
the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of Necessary Claims
will be satisfied if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee
or assignee of any patent that it knows contains Necessary Claims or
necessary claims under this License. Nothing in this License requires
Contributor to undertake a patent search. If Contributor is 1) employed by
or acting on behalf of an employer, 2) is making a Contribution under the
direction or control of a third party, or 3) is making the Contribution
as a consultant, contractor, or under another similar relationship with
a third party, Contributor represents that they have been authorized by
that party to enter into this License on its behalf.

8.2. Distribution Disclaimer. Any distributions of technical
information to third parties must include a notice materially similar
to the following: “THESE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” The
Contributors and Licensees expressly disclaim any warranties (express,
implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability,
non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to
the materials. The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the
materials is assumed by the implementer and user. IN NO EVENT WILL THE
CONTRIBUTORS OR LICENSEES BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS
OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO
THIS DELIVERABLE OR ITS GOVERNING AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT
THE OTHER MEMBER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.”
