            &lt;p&gt;Unless expressly stated otherwise, every Contribution that You have
            intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Subject Matter of the License is
            subject to this License without any additional terms or conditions applying.
            Irrespective of the above, none of the terms or conditions contained herein may
            be interpreted to supersede or modify the terms or conditions of any separate
            licensing agreement that You may have concluded with a Licensor for such

            Matter of the License is not complete and may therefore contain errors (&amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot;)
            or additional patents of Contributors or third parties, as is inherent in this

            liable for direct or indirect, material or immaterial loss or damage of any kind
            arising from the License or the use of the Subject Matter of the License; this
            applies, among other things, but not exclusively, to loss of goodwill, loss of
            production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic loss or
            damage, even if the Contributor has been notified of the possibility of such
            loss or damage. Irrespective of the above, the Licensor shall only be liable
            within the scope of statutory product liability to the extent that the
            respective provisions are applicable to the Subject Matter of the License or the
            Contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Except in cases of intentional conduct, the Contributors, their legal
            representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for any
            infringement of third-party patent or intellectual property rights arising from
            the Contributions nor do they warrant that the Contributions are accurate,

            Works, You are free to accept support, warranty, indemnity or other liability
            obligations and/or rights consistent with this License and to charge a fee in
            return. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
            behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
            and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
            for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
            reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;/p&gt;

reproduction or distribution of Your modifications or for those Derivative Works
as a whole, provided that Your use, reproduction and distribution of the work
complies with the terms and conditions set out in this License in all other
respects.

service marks or product names of the Licensor(s) or of a Contributor.

§7 Limited warranty

This License is granted free of charge and thus constitutes a gift. Accordingly,
any warranty is excluded. The Subject Matter of the License is a work in

or additional patents of Contributors or third parties, as is inherent in this
type of development.

within the scope of statutory product liability to the extent that the
respective provisions are applicable to the Subject Matter of the License or the
Contribution.

Except in cases of intentional conduct, the Contributors, their legal
representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for any
infringement of third-party patent or intellectual property rights arising from
the Contributions nor do they warrant that the Contributions are accurate,
devoid of mistakes, complete and/or fit for any particular purpose.

§9 Provision of warranties or assumption of additional liability in the event of
distribution of the Subject Matter of the License

In the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License or Derivative
Works, You are free to accept support, warranty, indemnity or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License and to charge a fee in
return. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,

The Subject Matter of the License is a work in progress; it is constantly being improved by countless Contributors. The Subject Matter of the License is not complete and may therefore contain errors ("bugs") or additional patents of Contributors or third parties, as is inherent in this type of development.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="§8";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitation of liability
   Except in cases of intentional and grossly negligent conduct, the Contributors, their legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for direct or indirect, material or immaterial loss or damage of any kind arising from the License or the use of the Subject Matter of the License; this applies, among other things, but not exclusively, to loss of goodwill, loss of production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic loss or damage, even if the Contributor has been notified of the possibility of such loss or damage. Irrespective of the above, the Licensor shall only be liable within the scope of statutory product liability to the extent that the respective provisions are applicable to the Subject Matter of the License or the Contribution.

   Except in cases of intentional conduct, the Contributors, their legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for any infringement of third-party patent or intellectual property rights arising from the Contributions nor do they warrant that the Contributions are accurate, devoid of mistakes, complete and/or fit for any particular purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="§9";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Provision of warranties or assumption of additional liability in the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License
   In the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License or Derivative Works, You are free to accept support, warranty, indemnity or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License and to charge a fee in return. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="§10";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Applicable law
   This License is governed by German law, excluding its conflict of laws provisions and the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
