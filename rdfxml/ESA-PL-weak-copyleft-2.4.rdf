2 Grant of Rights

 

2.1 Copyright

The Licensor, and each Contributor in respect of such Contributor’s Modifications, hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under Copyright, subject to the terms and conditions of this License, to:

use the Software;
reproduce the Software by any or all means and in any or all form;
Modify the Software and create works based on the Software;
communicate to the public, including making available, display or perform the Software or copies thereof to the public;
Distribute, sublicense, lend and rent the Software.
The license grant is perpetual and irrevocable, unless terminated pursuant to Sec. 8.

 

2.2 Patents

Each Contributor in respect of such Contributor’s Modifications, hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license under Patent Claims to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted under Sec. 2.1, including but not limited to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export and Distribute such Contributor’s Modifications and the combination of such Contributor’s Modifications with the Contributor Version (collectively called the “Patent Licensed Version” of the Software).

No patent license is granted for claims that are infringed:

only as a consequence of further modification of the Patent Licensed Version; or
by the combination of the Patent Licensed Version with other software or other devices or hardware, unless such combination was an intended use case of the Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library is intended to be used with other software, a satellite navigation software is intended to be used with appropriate hardware); or
by a Modification under Patent Claims in the absence of the Contributor’s Modifications or by a combination of the Contributor’s Modifications with software other than the Patent Licensed Version or Modifications thereof.
 

2.3 Trademark

This License does not grant permission to use trade names, trademarks, services marks, logos or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and as reasonable necessary to comply with the obligations of this License (e.g. by reproducing the content of the notices). For the avoidance of doubt, upon Distribution of Modifications You must not use the Licensor’s or ESA’s trademarks, names or logos in any way that states or implies, or can be interpreted as stating or implying, that the final product is endorsed or created by the Licensor or ESA.

 

3 Distribution

 

3.1 Copyleft Clause

All Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications, as Source Code or Object Code, must be, as a whole, either under (a) the terms of this License or the ESA-PL Strong Copyleft license v2.4 or (b) any later version of these Licenses unless the Software is expressly Distributed only under a specific version of the License by a Contributor or (c) the terms of a compatible license as listed in Appendix A to this License. Any obligation in this License to Distribute under the terms of this License, in particular as set out in Sec. 3.2, shall be construed as referring to “this License or a compatible license”.

3.2 Copyleft exceptions

3.2.1 Compilations. In the event of the Distribution of a compilation of Software and/or Modifications with other separate and independent works (for example in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium), which are not by their nature extensions or other modifications of the Software and/or the Modifications, and which are not combined with it such as to form a single larger program, Distribution of the compilation does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the compilation.

3.2.2 System Libraries. System Libraries used by a Modification need not be Distributed under the terms of this License and need not be included as part of the Source Code pursuant to Sec. 3.3. “System Library” means anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (kernel, window system etc.) of the operating system(s) on which the Software or Modification runs, or a compiler used to produce the Object Code, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

3.2.3 External Modules. You may create a Modification by combining Software with an external module enabling supplementary functions or services and Distribute the external module under different license terms, provided that the external module and the Software run in separate address spaces, with one calling the other, or each other interfacing, when they are run.

3.2.4 Combinations. You may create a Modification (the “Combination”) by combining or linking the Software or Modifications thereof (the “Covered Code”) with additional code or software (the “External Code”) not governed by the terms of this License and Distribute the Combination

in Object Code form under any license terms, and/or
in Source Code form with the External Code’s Source Code under any license terms and the Covered Code’s Source Code under this License,
provided that:
the Covered Code will be governed by this License and the different license terms effectively do not restrict the rights granted by this License; and
the External Code and its license terms are clearly identified and notice is given of the use of Covered Code and the applicability of this License; and
the External Code’s Source Code is clearly separated from the Covered Code’s Source Code (usually contained in different files); and
You communicate the Covered Code’s Source Code in accordance with Sec. 3.3. 
 

3.3 Communication of the Source Code

If You Distribute the Software and/or Modifications as Object Code, You must:

provide in addition a copy of the Source Code of the Software and/or Modifications to each recipient; or
make the Source Code of the Software and/or Modifications freely accessible by reasonable means for anyone who possesses the Object Code or received the Software and/or Modifications from You, and inform recipients how to obtain a copy of the Source Code. Such information needs to be included at a minimum in the “NOTICE” file pursuant to Sec. 4.4 You are obliged to make the Source Code accessible in accordance with this Section for as long as You continue to Distribute the Software and/or Modifications and at a minimum for a three year period following Your last Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications.
 

3.4 Dual Licensing

This License gives no permission to license the Software or Modifications in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if You have separately received it.

 

4 Notices

The following obligations apply in the event of any Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications as Source Code and/or Object Code:

4.1 You must include a copy of this License and all of the notices set out in this Sec. 4.

4.2 You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices nor any of the notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary for your compliance with this License or otherwise permitted by this License, except for those notices that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.

4.3 Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified and the date of modification and identify itself as the originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably allows identification and contact with the Contributor. The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text file included with the Distribution titled “CHANGELOG”.

4.4 The Software may include a "NOTICE" text file containing general notices. Any Contributor can create such a NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as an addendum to the original text, provided that such notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

4.5 Each Contributor must identify all of its Patent Claims by providing at a minimum the patent number and identification and contact information in a text file included with the Distribution titled "LEGAL".

 

5 Warranty and Liability 

5.1 Each Contributor warrants and represents that it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Modifications conveyed by this License.

5.2 Except as expressly set forth in this License, the Software is provided to You on an “as is” basis and without warranties of any kind, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

5.3 Except as expressly set forth in this License, neither Licensor nor any Contributor shall be liable, including, without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including without limitation loss of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability, arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of the Software or the exercise of any rights under this License, even if You have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims, e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

 

6 Additional Agreements

While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity, liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided such additional agreements are consistent with this License and do not effectively restrict the recipient’s rights under this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 

7 Infringements

7.1 You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after receiving a third party notification of infringement) would expose you to the risk of being considered as intentionally infringing third party rights. In such event You should acquire the respective rights or modify the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.

 

8 Termination

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You with the terms of this License if you fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

8.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent and copyright licenses granted to You under this License for the Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

8.3 Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior to termination shall continue and survive termination.

 

9 Applicable Law, Arbitration and Compliance

9.1 This License is governed by the laws of the ESA Member State where the Licensor resides or has his registered office. “Member States” are the members of the European Space Agency pursuant to Art. 1 of the ESA Convention[1]. This licence shall be governed by German law if a dispute arises with the ESA as a Licensor or if the Licensor has no residence or registered office inside a Member State.

9.2 Any dispute arising out of this License shall be finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators designated in conformity with those rules. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Cologne, Germany. The award shall be final and binding on the parties, no appeal shall lie against it. The enforcement of the award shall be governed by the rules of procedure in force in the state/country in which it is to be executed.

9.3 For the avoidance of doubt, You are solely responsible for compliance with current applicable requirements of national laws. The Software can be subject to export control laws. If You export the Software it is your responsibility to comply with all export control laws. This may include different requirements, as e.g. registering the Software with the local authorities.

9.4 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License due to statute, judicial order or regulation You must:

comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
describe the limitations and the Object Code and/or Source Code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL notice described in Section 4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for an average recipient to be able to understand it.
 

10 Miscellaneous

10.1 Only ESA has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. ESA may assign this right to other individuals or legal entities. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

10.3 If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall not be affected. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be construed and/or reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and valid.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Contributor in respect of such Contributor&amp;apos;s
                  Modifications, hereby grants You a world-wide,
                  royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license
                  under Patent Claims to the extent necessary to make
                  use of the rights granted under Sec. 2.1, including but
                  not limited to make, have made, use, sell, offer for
                  sale, import, export and Distribute such Contributor&amp;apos;s
                  Modifications and the combination of such Contributor&amp;apos;s
                  Modifications with the Contributor Version (collectively
                  called the &amp;quot;Patent Licensed Version&amp;quot; of the Software).
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  No patent license is granted for claims that are infringed:
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  only as a consequence of further modification of the Patent
                  Licensed Version; or by the combination of the Patent Licensed
                  Version with other software or other devices or hardware,
                  unless such combination was an intended use case of the
                  Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library
                  is intended to be used with other software, a satellite
                  navigation software is intended to be used with appropriate
                  hardware); or by a Modification under Patent Claims in the
                  absence of the Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications or by a combination
                  of the Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications with software other
                  than the Patent Licensed Version or Modifications thereof.
               &lt;/p&gt;

                  This License does not grant permission to use trade names,
                  trademarks, services marks, logos or names of the Licensor,
                  except as required for reasonable and customary use in
                  describing the origin of the Software and as reasonable
                  necessary to comply with the obligations of this License
                  (e.g. by reproducing the content of the notices). For the
                  avoidance of doubt, upon Distribution of Modifications
                  You must not use the Licensor&amp;apos;s or ESA&amp;apos;s trademarks,
                  names or logos in any way that states or implies, or can
                  be interpreted as stating or implying, that the final
                  product is endorsed or created by the Licensor or ESA.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  All Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications, as
                  Source Code or Object Code, must be, as a whole, either
                  under (a) the terms of this License or the ESA-PL Strong
                  Copyleft license v2.4 or (b) any later version of these
                  Licenses unless the Software is expressly Distributed only
                  under a specific version of the License by a Contributor
                  or (c) the terms of a compatible license as listed
                  in Appendix A to this License. Any obligation in this
                  License to Distribute under the terms of this License,
                  in particular as set out in Sec. 3.2, shall be construed
                  as referring to &amp;quot;this License or a compatible license&amp;quot;.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Compilations.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  In the event of the Distribution of a compilation of Software
                  and/or Modifications with other separate and independent works
                  (for example in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
                  medium), which are not by their nature extensions or other
                  modifications of the Software and/or the Modifications,
                  and which are not combined with it such as to form a single
                  larger program, Distribution of the compilation does not cause
                  this License to apply to the other parts of the compilation.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt;&lt;span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"&gt; 3.2.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;
                  System Libraries.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  System Libraries used by a Modification need not be
                  Distributed under the terms of this License and need
                  not be included as part of the Source Code pursuant
                  to Sec. 3.3. &amp;quot;System Library&amp;quot; means anything that is
                  normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
                  with the major components (kernel, window system etc.)
                  of the operating system(s) on which the Software or
                  Modification runs, or a compiler used to produce the
                  Object Code, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  External Modules.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  You may create a Modification by combining Software with
                  an external module enabling supplementary functions or
                  services and Distribute the external module under different
                  license terms, provided that the external module and the
                  Software run in separate address spaces, with one calling
                  the other, or each other interfacing, when they are run.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;

                  Combinations.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  You may create a Modification (the &amp;quot;Combination&amp;quot;) by
                  combining or linking the Software or Modifications
                  thereof (the &amp;quot;Covered Code&amp;quot;) with additional code or
                  software (the &amp;quot;External Code&amp;quot;) not governed by the
                  terms of this License and Distribute the Combination
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  in Object Code form under any license terms, and/or in Source
                  Code form with the External Code&amp;apos;s Source Code under any
                  license terms and the Covered Code&amp;apos;s Source Code under this
                  License, provided that: the Covered Code will be governed
                  by this License and the different license terms effectively
                  do not restrict the rights granted by this License; and the
                  External Code and its license terms are clearly identified
                  and notice is given of the use of Covered Code and the
                  applicability of this License; and the External Code&amp;apos;s Source
                  Code is clearly separated from the Covered Code&amp;apos;s Source Code
                  (usually contained in different files); and You communicate
                  the Covered Code&amp;apos;s Source Code in accordance with Sec. 3.3.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  If You Distribute the Software and/or
                  Modifications as Object Code, You must:
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  provide in addition a copy of the Source Code of the
                  Software and/or Modifications to each recipient; or make
                  the Source Code of the Software and/or Modifications freely
                  accessible by reasonable means for anyone who possesses the
                  Object Code or received the Software and/or Modifications
                  from You, and inform recipients how to obtain a copy of
                  the Source Code. Such information needs to be included
                  at a minimum in the &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; file pursuant to Sec. 4.4
                  You are obliged to make the Source Code accessible in
                  accordance with this Section for as long as You continue
                  to Distribute the Software and/or Modifications and at
                  a minimum for a three year period following Your last
                  Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications.
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  This License gives no permission to license the Software or
                  Modifications in any other way, but it does not invalidate
                  such permission if You have separately received it.

                  You must include a copy of this License and

                  You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,

                  notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary
                  for your compliance with this License or otherwise
                  permitted by this License, except for those notices
                  that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying
                  prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified
                  and the date of modification and identify itself as the
                  originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably
                  allows identification and contact with the Contributor.
                  The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text
                  file included with the Distribution titled &amp;quot;CHANGELOG&amp;quot;.

                  The Software may include a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file containing
                  general notices. Any Contributor can create such a
                  NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as
                  an addendum to the original text, provided that such

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Contributor must identify all of its Patent
                  Claims by providing at a minimum the patent number
                  and identification and contact information in a text
                  file included with the Distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;.

                  without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or
                  consequential damages (including without limitation loss
                  of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability,
                  arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of
                  the Software or the exercise of any rights under this
                  License, even if You have been advised of the possibility
                  of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims,
                  e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception
                  or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

                  Additional Agreements
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may
                  choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for
                  charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity,
                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient&amp;apos;s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing
                  that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after
                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such
                  event You should acquire the respective rights or modify
                  the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.
               &lt;/p&gt;

                  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
                  terminate automatically upon any breach by You with

                  If You institute patent litigation against any entity
                  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
                  alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory
                  patent infringement, then any patent and copyright
                  licenses granted to You under this License for the Software
                  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior
                  to termination shall continue and survive termination.

                  Space Agency pursuant to Art. 1 of the ESA Convention[1].
                  This licence shall be governed by German law if a dispute
                  arises with the ESA as a Licensor or if the Licensor has
                  no residence or registered office inside a Member State.

                  Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Cologne,
                  Germany. The award shall be final and binding on the
                  parties, no appeal shall lie against it. The enforcement
                  of the award shall be governed by the rules of procedure in
                  force in the state/country in which it is to be executed.

                  For the avoidance of doubt, You are solely responsible
                  for compliance with current applicable requirements
                  of national laws. The Software can be subject to
                  export control laws. If You export the Software it is
                  your responsibility to comply with all export control
                  laws. This may include different requirements, as e.g.
                  registering the Software with the local authorities.

                  must be included in the LEGAL notice described in
                  Section 4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
                  regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
                  for an average recipient to be able to understand it.

   All Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications, as Source Code or Object Code, must be, as a whole, either under (a) the terms of this License or the ESA-PL Strong Copyleft license v2.4 or (b) any later version of these Licenses unless the Software is expressly Distributed only under a specific version of the License by a Contributor or (c) the terms of a compatible license as listed in Appendix A to this License. Any obligation in this License to Distribute under the terms of this License, in particular as set out in Sec. 3.2, shall be construed as referring to "this License or a compatible license".

   Copyleft exceptions

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Compilations.

   In the event of the Distribution of a compilation of Software and/or Modifications with other separate and independent works (for example in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium), which are not by their nature extensions or other modifications of the Software and/or the Modifications, and which are not combined with it such as to form a single larger program, Distribution of the compilation does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the compilation.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   System Libraries.

   System Libraries used by a Modification need not be Distributed under the terms of this License and need not be included as part of the Source Code pursuant to Sec. 3.3. "System Library" means anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (kernel, window system etc.) of the operating system(s) on which the Software or Modification runs, or a compiler used to produce the Object Code, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   External Modules.

   You may create a Modification by combining Software with an external module enabling supplementary functions or services and Distribute the external module under different license terms, provided that the external module and the Software run in separate address spaces, with one calling the other, or each other interfacing, when they are run.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Combinations.

   You may create a Modification (the "Combination") by combining or linking the Software or Modifications thereof (the "Covered Code") with additional code or software (the "External Code") not governed by the terms of this License and Distribute the Combination

   in Object Code form under any license terms, and/or in Source Code form with the External Code's Source Code under any license terms and the Covered Code's Source Code under this License, provided that: the Covered Code will be governed by this License and the different license terms effectively do not restrict the rights granted by this License; and the External Code and its license terms are clearly identified and notice is given of the use of Covered Code and the applicability of this License; and the External Code's Source Code is clearly separated from the Covered Code's Source Code (usually contained in different files); and You communicate the Covered Code's Source Code in accordance with Sec. 3.3.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Communication of the Source Code

   If You Distribute the Software and/or Modifications as Object Code, You must:

   provide in addition a copy of the Source Code of the Software and/or Modifications to each recipient; or make the Source Code of the Software and/or Modifications freely accessible by reasonable means for anyone who possesses the Object Code or received the Software and/or Modifications from You, and inform recipients how to obtain a copy of the Source Code. Such information needs to be included at a minimum in the "NOTICE" file pursuant to Sec. 4.4 You are obliged to make the Source Code accessible in accordance with this Section for as long as You continue to Distribute the Software and/or Modifications and at a minimum for a three year period following Your last Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Dual Licensing

   This License gives no permission to license the Software or Modifications in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if You have separately received it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Notices

   The following obligations apply in the event of any Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications as Source Code and/or Object Code:

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   You must include a copy of this License and all of the notices set out in this Sec. 4.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices nor any of the notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary for your compliance with this License or otherwise permitted by this License, except for those notices that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified and the date of modification and identify itself as the originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably allows identification and contact with the Contributor. The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text file included with the Distribution titled "CHANGELOG".

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   The Software may include a "NOTICE" text file containing general notices. Any Contributor can create such a NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as an addendum to the original text, provided that such notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Each Contributor must identify all of its Patent Claims by providing at a minimum the patent number and identification and contact information in a text file included with the Distribution titled "LEGAL".

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Warranty and Liability

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Each Contributor warrants and represents that it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Modifications conveyed by this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Except as expressly set forth in this License, the Software is provided to You on an "as is" basis and without warranties of any kind, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Except as expressly set forth in this License, neither Licensor nor any Contributor shall be liable, including, without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including without limitation loss of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability, arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of the Software or the exercise of any rights under this License, even if You have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims, e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Additional Agreements

   While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity, liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided such additional agreements are consistent with this License and do not effectively restrict the recipient's rights under this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Infringements

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after receiving a third party notification of infringement) would expose you to the risk of being considered as intentionally infringing third party rights. In such event You should acquire the respective rights or modify the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Termination

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You with the terms of this License if you fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent and copyright licenses granted to You under this License for the Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior to termination shall continue and survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

The enforcement of the award shall be governed by the rules of procedure in force in the state/country in which it is to be executed.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   For the avoidance of doubt, You are solely responsible for compliance with current applicable requirements of national laws. The Software can be subject to export control laws. If You export the Software it is your responsibility to comply with all export control laws. This may include different requirements, as e.g. registering the Software with the local authorities.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License due to statute, judicial order or regulation You must:

   comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and describe the limitations and the Object Code and/or Source Code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL notice described in Section 4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for an average recipient to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
