By exercising rights granted to you under this agreement, you accept and agree
to its terms.

free of charge, to deal in the Model Materials without restriction, including

embodied therein.

If you distribute any portion of the Model Materials, you shall retain in your
distribution (1) a copy of this agreement, and (2) all copyright notices and
other notices of origin included in the Model Materials that are applicable to
your distribution.

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against any
person or entity asserting that the Model Materials directly or indirectly
infringe any patent, then all rights and grants made to you hereunder are
terminated, unless that lawsuit was in response to a corresponding lawsuit
first brought against you.

This agreement does not impose any restrictions or obligations with respect to
any use, modification, or sharing of any outputs generated by using the Model
Materials.

THE MODEL MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS

REQUIRED FOR ANY USE OF THE MODEL MATERIALS; OR (3) PERFORMING ANY DUE
DILIGENCE OR UNDERTAKING ANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MODEL MATERIALS OR
ANYTHING INCORPORATED OR EMBODIED THEREIN.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROVIDERS OF THE MODEL MATERIALS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
