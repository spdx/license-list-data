       irrevocable offer to provide a copy of the modified Source Code
       (on an acceptable machine-readable medium) for up to three years
       at the cost of materials and delivery. Such redistributions must
       allow further use, modification, and redistribution of the Source
       Code under substantially the same terms as this license. For
       the purposes of redistribution "Source Code" means the complete
       human-readable, compilable, linkable, and operational source
       code of the redistributed module(s) including all modifications.

2. Redistributions of the Software Source Code must retain the
