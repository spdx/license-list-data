   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; substitutes for any other product or service we offer using the Software that exists as of the date we make the Software available; or
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; offers the same or substantially similar functionality as the Software.
Permitted Purposes specifically include using the Software:

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for your internal use and access;
