PREAMBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an "open source" distribution model.&#xD;

In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security.
