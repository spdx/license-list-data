2 Grant of Rights



2.1 Copyright



The Licensor, and each Contributor in respect of such Contributor’s Modifications, hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under Copyright, subject to the terms and conditions of this License, to:

·      use the Software;

·      reproduce the Software by any or all means and in any or all form;

·      Modify the Software and create works based on the Software;

·      communicate to the public, including making available, display or perform the Software or copies thereof to the public;

·      Distribute, sublicense, lend and rent the Software.



The license grant is perpetual and irrevocable, unless terminated pursuant to Sec. 8.



2.2 Patents



Each Contributor in respect of such Contributor’s Modifications, hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license under Patent Claims to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted under Sec. 2.1, including but not limited to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export and Distribute such Contributor’s Modifications and the combination of such Contributor’s Modifications with the Contributor Version (collectively called the “Patent Licensed Version” of the Software).



No patent license is granted for claims that are infringed:

·      only as a consequence of further modification of the Patent Licensed Version; or

·      by the combination of the Patent Licensed Version with other software or other devices or hardware, unless such combination was an intended use case of the Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library is intended to be used with other software, a satellite navigation software is intended to be used with appropriate hardware); or

·      by a Modification under Patent Claims in the absence of the Contributor’s Modifications or by a combination of the Contributor’s Modifications with software other than the Patent Licensed Version or Modifications thereof.



2.3 Trademark



This License does not grant permission to use trade names, trademarks, services marks, logos or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and as reasonable necessary to comply with the obligations of this License (e.g. by reproducing the content of the notices). For the avoidance of doubt, upon Distribution of Modifications You must not use the Licensor’s or ESA’s trademarks, names or logos in any way that states or implies, or can be interpreted as stating or implying, that the final product is endorsed or created by the Licensor or ESA.



3 Distribution



3.1 No Copyleft



You may Distribute the Software and/or Modifications, as Source Code or Object Code, under any license terms, provided that

(a)  notice is given of the use of the Software and the applicability of this License to the Software; and

(b) You make best efforts to ensure that further Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications (including further Modifications) is subject to the obligations set forth in this Sec. 3.1 (a) and (b).



4 Notices



The following obligations apply in the event of any Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications as Source Code and/or Object Code:



4.1 You must include a copy of this License and all of the notices set out in this Sec. 4.



4.2 You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices nor any of the notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary for your compliance with this License or otherwise permitted by this License, except for those notices that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.



4.3 Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified and the date of modification and identify itself as the originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably allows identification and contact with the Contributor. The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text file included with the Distribution titled “CHANGELOG”.



4.4 The Software may include a "NOTICE" text file containing general notices. Any Contributor can create such a NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as an addendum to the original text, provided that such notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.



4.5 Each Contributor must identify all of its Patent Claims by providing at a minimum the patent number and identification and contact information in a text file included with the Distribution titled "LEGAL".



5 Warranty and Liability



5.1 Each Contributor warrants and represents that it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Modifications conveyed by this License.



5.2 Except as expressly set forth in this License, the Software is provided to You on an “as is” basis and without warranties of any kind, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.



5.3 Except as expressly set forth in this License, neither Licensor nor any Contributor shall be liable, including, without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including without limitation loss of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability, arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of the Software or the exercise of any rights under this License, even if You have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims, e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.



6 Additional Agreements



While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity, liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided such additional agreements are consistent with this License and do not effectively restrict the recipient’s rights under this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.



7 Infringements



You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after receiving a third party notification of infringement) would expose you to the risk of being considered as intentionally infringing third party rights. In such event You should acquire the respective rights or modify the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.



8 Termination



8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You with the terms of this License if you fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.



8.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent and copyright licenses granted to You under this License for the Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.



8.3 Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior to termination shall continue and survive termination.



9 Applicable Law, Arbitration and Compliance



9.1 This License is governed by the laws of the ESA Member State where the Licensor resides or has his registered office. “Member States” are the members of the European Space Agency pursuant to Art. 1 of the ESA Convention[1]. This licence shall be governed by German law if a dispute arises with the ESA as a Licensor or if the Licensor has no residence or registered office inside a Member State.



9.2 Any dispute arising out of this License shall be finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators designated in conformity with those rules. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Cologne, Germany. The award shall be final and binding on the parties, no appeal shall lie against it. The enforcement of the award shall be governed by the rules of procedure in force in the state/country in which it is to be executed.



9.3 For the avoidance of doubt, You are solely responsible for compliance with current applicable requirements of national laws. The Software can be subject to export control laws. If You export the Software it is your responsibility to comply with all export control laws. This may include different requirements, as e.g. registering the Software with the local authorities.



9.4 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License due to statute, judicial order or regulation You must:

(a)  comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and

(b) describe the limitations and the Object Code and/or Source Code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL notice described in Section 4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for an average recipient to be able to understand it.



10 Miscellaneous



10.1 Only ESA has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. ESA may assign this right to other individuals or legal entities. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.



10.2 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.



10.3 If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall not be affected. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be construed and/or reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and valid.

                  the Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library

                  necessary to comply with the obligations of this License
                  (e.g. by reproducing the content of the notices). For the
                  avoidance of doubt, upon Distribution of Modifications
                  You must not use the Licensor&amp;apos;s or ESA&amp;apos;s trademarks,

                  You may Distribute the Software and/or

                  Distribution of the Software and/or Modifications
                  (including further Modifications) is subject to the
                  obligations set forth in this Sec. 3.1 (a) and (b).

               &lt;p&gt;
                  You must include a copy of this License and

                  notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary
                  for your compliance with this License or otherwise
                  permitted by this License, except for those notices
                  that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying
                  prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified
                  and the date of modification and identify itself as the
                  originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably
                  allows identification and contact with the Contributor.
                  The aforementioned notices must at a minimum be in a text
                  file included with the Distribution titled &amp;quot;CHANGELOG&amp;quot;.

                  The Software may include a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file containing
                  general notices. Any Contributor can create such a
                  NOTICE file or add notices to it, alongside or as
                  an addendum to the original text, provided that such
                  notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Each Contributor must identify all of its Patent
                  Claims by providing at a minimum the patent number
                  and identification and contact information in a text
                  file included with the Distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;.

                  Each Contributor warrants and represents that
                  it has sufficient rights to grant the rights

                  Software is provided to You on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis and without
                  warranties of any kind, including without limitation
                  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                  absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement
                  of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory
                  warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception
                  or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.
               &lt;/p&gt;

                  Except as expressly set forth in this License, neither
                  Licensor nor any Contributor shall be liable, including,
                  without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or
                  consequential damages (including without limitation loss
                  of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability,
                  arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of
                  the Software or the exercise of any rights under this
                  License, even if You have been advised of the possibility
                  of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims,
                  e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception
                  or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.
               &lt;/p&gt;

                  Additional Agreements
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may
                  choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for
                  charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity,
                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient&amp;apos;s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Infringements
               &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing
                  that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after
                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such
                  event You should acquire the respective rights or modify
                  the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.
               &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;
                  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
                  terminate automatically upon any breach by You with
                  the terms of this License if you fail to cure such
                  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  If You institute patent litigation against any entity
                  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
                  alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory
                  patent infringement, then any patent and copyright
                  licenses granted to You under this License for the Software
                  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior
                  to termination shall continue and survive termination.

                  This License is governed by the laws of the ESA Member
                  State where the Licensor resides or has his registered

                  Space Agency pursuant to Art. 1 of the ESA Convention[1].
                  This licence shall be governed by German law if a dispute
                  arises with the ESA as a Licensor or if the Licensor has
                  no residence or registered office inside a Member State.

               &lt;p&gt;
                  Any dispute arising out of this License shall be finally
                  settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of
                  the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more
                  arbitrators designated in conformity with those rules.
                  Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Cologne,
                  Germany. The award shall be final and binding on the
                  parties, no appeal shall lie against it. The enforcement
                  of the award shall be governed by the rules of procedure in
                  force in the state/country in which it is to be executed.

                  For the avoidance of doubt, You are solely responsible
                  for compliance with current applicable requirements
                  of national laws. The Software can be subject to
                  export control laws. If You export the Software it is
                  your responsibility to comply with all export control
                  laws. This may include different requirements, as e.g.
                  registering the Software with the local authorities.

   You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices nor any of the notices set out in this Sec. 4, except as necessary for your compliance with this License or otherwise permitted by this License, except for those notices that do not pertain to the Modifications You Distribute.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Each Contributor must cause its Modification carrying prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified and the date of modification and identify itself as the originator of its Modifications in a manner that reasonably allows identification and contact with the Contributor.

   Warranty and Liability

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Each Contributor warrants and represents that it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Modifications conveyed by this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Except as expressly set forth in this License, the Software is provided to You on an "as is" basis and without warranties of any kind, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy or non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Mandatory statutory warranty claims, e.g. in the event of wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Except as expressly set forth in this License, neither Licensor nor any Contributor shall be liable, including, without limitation, for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including without limitation loss of profit), however caused and on any theory of liability, arising in any way out of the use or Distribution of the Software or the exercise of any rights under this License, even if You have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Mandatory statutory liability claims, e.g. in the event of wilful misconduct, wilful deception or fraudulent misrepresentation, shall remain unaffected.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Additional Agreements

   While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity, liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided such additional agreements are consistent with this License and do not effectively restrict the recipient's rights under this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Infringements

   You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after receiving a third party notification of infringement) would expose you to the risk of being considered as intentionally infringing third party rights. In such event You should acquire the respective rights or modify the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Termination

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent and copyright licenses granted to You under this License for the Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;
   Any licenses validly granted by You under the License prior to termination shall continue and survive termination.
