    <rdfs:comment>This license is mostly a match to Apache-1.1 (except for the addition of "open source" before "software" in the clause 3 acknowledgement, and different text in the last paragraph, which is optional in Apache-1.1. It has its own entry on the SPDX License List due to the OSI having approved it.</rdfs:comment>
