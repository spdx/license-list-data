          Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
             Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
             sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
             License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature,
