      <p>PREAMBLE</p>

      <p>The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness.</p>

      <p>In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses,
         loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it
         without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This
         occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a &quot;third party&quot;.</p>

      <p>While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being
         unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular.
         After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently
         finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and
         expansion of the overall open source software base.</p>

      <p>While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RPL is found in two
         definitions: &quot;Deploy&quot; and &quot;Required Components&quot;.</p>

      <p>Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to
         the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside
         party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software.</p>

      <p>Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. --
         regardless of whether they&apos;re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server
         application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.</p>

      <p>In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition
         as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).</p>

      <p>The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document.</p>

          Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to
             trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
             or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3

             require additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant in its
             sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
             such marks are included in the Licensed Software. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
             to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that

          You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the
             licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software set forth herein, no assurances
             are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the

             Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
             infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
             rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any
             other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
             license is required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your
             responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Software.

             or Required Components (collectively Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute
             are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any
             Extensions that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this

             create derivatives, sublicense, and distribute Licensed Software, in any form. Any Extensions
             You make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or
             Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License or
             directions on how to obtain a copy with every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree
             not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed

             Deploy and must remain available for no less than twelve (12) months after the date You cease
             to Deploy. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code to each version You Deploy
             remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
             party. You may not charge a fee for any copy of the Source Code distributed under this Section

                 posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs, or other sites where a publicly
                 accessible search engine would reasonably be expected to index your post in relationship to

             alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
             plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by
             the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability

          Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being
             Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another
             license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your
             Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict
             with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
             conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission
             will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

          Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised versions of the License.
             Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
             always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
             Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by

          If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply
             it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your

             not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this

          Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for
             claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
             this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.
             This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
             Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
             use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties
             and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and
             Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms
             of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed

          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a
             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to
             herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any
             patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of
             this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the
             &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed
             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty
             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and
             4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

             is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under
             Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
             or license.

      &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL1.5)&#10;&#10;Version 1.5, July 15, 2007&#10;&#10;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;copyright&quot;;original&#61;&quot;Copyright (C) 2001-2007 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.  &quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,5000}&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;PREAMBLE&#10;&#10;The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness.&#10;&#10;In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a &quot;third party&quot;.&#10;&#10;While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.&#10;&#10;While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RPL is found in two definitions: &quot;Deploy&quot; and &quot;Required Components&quot;.&#10;&#10;Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software.&#10;&#10;Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they&#39;re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.&#10;&#10;In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).&#10;&#10;The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document.&#10;&#10;LICENSE TERMS&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;1.0&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; General; Applicability &amp; Definitions.
