If any of the Original Code becomes the subject ofa claim of infringement (\"Affected Original Code\"), Apple may, at its sole discretion and option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary for You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b) modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer infringing; or (c) terminate Your rights to use the Affected Original Code, effective immediately upon Apple's posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License.\n\n     9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n\n10. Trademarks.

Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple's development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.\n\n12. Termination.\n\n     12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\n\n          (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\n\n          (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or\n\n          (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.\n\n     12.2 Effect of Termination.

All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party.\n\n13. Miscellaneous.\n\n     13.1 Export Law Assurances. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders. By using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.\n\n     13.2 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in\naccordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).

Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n     13.5 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n     13.6 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n     13.7 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\n     13.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.\n\n     Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1999 Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of\n               this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will\n               be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and\n               intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and\n               effect.
