<li><var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> a.</span></var> You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work (see section 8(a)). You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(b), as requested.</li>
                  
<li><var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> b.</span></var> If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) any attributions that the Licensor indicates be associated with the Work as indicated in a copyright notice, (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributors to the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Licensor or others designated for attribution, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Licensor or such others.</li>

Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License reinstates automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of You discovering the violation, or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(b) does not affect any rights the Licensor may have to seek remedies for violations of this License by You.</li>

To the extent possible, the Licensor waives the right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary licensing scheme.&#10;   This License lasts for the duration of the term of the copyright in the Work licensed by the Licensor. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work (see section 8(a)). You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(b), as requested.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) any attributions that the Licensor indicates be associated with the Work as indicated in a copyright notice, (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributors to the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Licensor or others designated for attribution, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Licensor or such others.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the honor or reputation of the Licensor where moral rights apply.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer&#10;   THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitation on Liability&#10;   IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this License, the license granted here lasts for the duration of the term of the copyright in the Work licensed by the Licensor as stated in Section 3. Notwithstanding the above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated below.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If You fail to comply with this License, then this License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License reinstates automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of You discovering the violation, or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(b) does not affect any rights the Licensor may have to seek remedies for violations of this License by You.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;8.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;a.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;b.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;c.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;d.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the Licensor.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;e.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Licensor with respect to the Work licensed here.
