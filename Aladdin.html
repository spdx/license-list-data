          Subject Matter
            <br />
   This License applies to the computer program known as &quot;Aladdin Ghostscript.&quot; The &quot;Program&quot;,
                 below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is
                 held by Aladdin Enterprises (the &quot;Licensor&quot;). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is
                 neither the program known as &quot;GNU Ghostscript&quot; nor the version of Ghostscript
                 available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc.

          <p>A &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as
             defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a
             modification.</p>

            <p>BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR
             ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
             DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE
             GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE
             ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY
             OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.</p>

          Licenses.
            <br />
   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all of the
                 restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an
                 unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (a)</span></var>
            You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program&apos;s source code as
               you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.

          Restrictions.
            <br />
   This license is subject to the following restrictions:

<li>
	
<ul style="list-style:none">
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (a)</span></var>
            Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to
               any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution,
               whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment
               for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that
               includes a copy of the Program &quot;without charge&quot;; these are only examples, and not an
               exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution
               involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:
          </li>
	    
<li>
	    
<ul style="list-style:none">

              Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for
                 which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service),
                 provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for
                 retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
                 to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or
                 service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line
                 service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that
                 company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

              Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files
                 containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all
                 information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without
                 charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying
                 documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media
                 include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be
                 an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this
                 section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive
                 enumeration.)

            Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject
               to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is
               not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this
               license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
               been made by running the Program).

               <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (c)</span></var>
            You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or
               publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
               thereof (&quot;the Work&quot;):

              If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent notices
                 stating that you have modified the Program&apos;s files and the date of any change. In each
                 source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have
                 modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
                 purpose of the change;
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (ii)</span></var>
              You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties
                 under the terms of this License;
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"><span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"> (iii)</span></var>
              If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each
                 time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an
                 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
                 that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute
                 the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the
                 copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is
                 interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request
                 of a user, such as in an &quot;About box&quot;, the Work is required to print or display the
                 notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but
                 does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an
                 announcement.);
            </li>
               
<li>

              You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
                 delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for a
                 work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
                 executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
                 contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                 control compilation and installation of the executable code. If you distribute with
                 the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
                 with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                 which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component
                 if you have it and are allowed to do so;
            </li>
               
<li>

              If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material
                 must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication
                 that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or
                 displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium;

              You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient&apos;s exercise of the rights
                 granted herein.
              <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability
                 to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source
                 code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
                 parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.</p>

          Reservation of Rights.
            <br />
   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not
                 copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under
                 this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
                 Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
                 not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

            <br />
   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any
                 reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
                 excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
                 body of this License.

            <p>For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a
             unit or agency of the United States Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit
             or agency, the following apply:</p>

            <p>If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (&quot;DOD&quot;), the Program and its documentation are
             classified as &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot;
             respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program
             and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is
             other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as &quot;commercial computer
             software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot; respectively and, pursuant to FAR

The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:&#10;      &#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(i)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company.

Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(b)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(c)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof (&quot;the Work&quot;):&#10;      &#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(i)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program&#39;s files and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the change;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(ii)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(iii)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an &quot;About box&quot;, the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(iv)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(v)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;(vi)&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient&#39;s exercise of the rights granted herein.&#10;         If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;3.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Reservation of Rights.&#10;   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;4.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Other Restrictions.&#10;   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;5.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Limitations.&#10;   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS IS,&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY.
