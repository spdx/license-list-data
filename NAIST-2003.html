            <p>A large portion of the dictionary entries
            originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
            Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.</p>

            <p>Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
            original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
            that the provisions of Section 3 (&quot;NO WARRANTY&quot;) will ALWAYS appear
            on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
            in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
            distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
            contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
            jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.</p>

            <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

            <p>The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
            research and development conducted during the project and is provided
            to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
            program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
            implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term &quot;warranty&quot; used herein
            includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
            performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
            the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
            any right of any third party.</p>

            <p>Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
            have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
            the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
            otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.</p>

            <p>Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
            organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
            development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
            officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
            damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
            and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
            with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
            or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
            regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
            knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
            project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
            foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
            &quot;use&quot; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
