          PREAMBLE
          <p>This license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application program interface (API).The license
             is intended to offer terms similar to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open
             standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these licenses require that, as a
             condition of the license of the software, any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work
             containing the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general use, without
             restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative works
             must likewise be made available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to
             the same General Public License terms as the original work.</p>

            <p>This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the standard licenses of this type in
             that it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this
             license nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative
             work. Rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is
             derived from the licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
             modification follow.</p>

              This License applies to any program (or other &quot;work&quot;) which contains a notice
                 placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 3dfx

              The term &quot;Program&quot; as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX&apos;s GLIDE source
                 code and object code and any Derivative Work.

              &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means, for the purpose of the License, that portion of any work
                 that contains the Program or the identifiable portion of a work that is derived from the
                 Program, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language,
                 and that performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other portions of a
                 work.

                 and includes the whole of such work.

              The &quot;Source Code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
                 modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source
                 code for all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files, and the
                 scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable work.

                     accompanies the executable code.

                  If distribution of executable code or object code is made by offering access to copy from
                     a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the
                     same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
                     not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

Some of these licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software, any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work.&#10;&#10;   This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; DEFINITIONS&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.1&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; This License applies to any program (or other &quot;work&quot;) which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.2&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; The term &quot;Program&quot; as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX&#39;s GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;2.3&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means, for the purpose of the License, that portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that performs 3D graphics API operations.
