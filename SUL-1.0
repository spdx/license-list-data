            patent, your patent license for the software granted under these

         <p>
            You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the
            software from you also gets a copy of these terms. If you modify the

         </p>

         <p>
            If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is
            not licensed, and your license will automatically terminate. If

            you cease all violation of this license no later than 30 days
            after you receive that notice, your license will be reinstated
            retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such
            reinstatement, any additional violation of these terms will
            cause your license to terminate automatically and permanently.
