However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"10.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Acceptance of the Licence\n   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon 'I agree' placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law.

Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\n   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\n\n   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value.
