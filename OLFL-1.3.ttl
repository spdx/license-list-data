The grant of license shall not include rights\nderiving from the patents which may in future become necessary for their lawful\nuse due to subsequent modifications to the Subject Matter or Contributions made\nby third parties after the original submission.\n\nIn the event that You institute patent litigation against any entity or person\n(including a counterclaim or countersuit in a legal action), alleging that the\nSubject Matter of the License or a Contribution incorporated or contained\ntherein constitutes patent infringement or indirect infringement, all patent\nlicenses which have been granted to You under this License for the Subject\nMatter of the License as well as this License itself shall be deemed terminated\nas of the date on which the action is filed.\n\n§4 Distribution\n\nYou may reproduce and distribute copies of the Subject Matter of the License or\nDerivative Works on any medium, with or without modifications (with regard to\nsoftware components in Source or Object form), provided that You comply with\nthe following rules:\n\n- You must provide all other recipients of the Subject Matter of the License or\n  of Derivative Works with a copy of this License and inform them that the\n  Subject Matter of the License was originally licensed under this License.\n- You must ensure that modified files contain prominent notices indicating that\n  You have modified the files.\n- You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices in\n  the Subject Matter of the License in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n  You distribute, with the exception of those notices that do not pertain to any\n  part of the Derivative Works.\n\nYou may add Your own copyright notices to Your modifications and state any\nadditional or different license conditions and conditions for the use,\nreproduction or distribution of Your modifications or for those Derivative Works\nas a whole, provided that Your use, reproduction and distribution of the work\ncomplies with the terms and conditions set out in this License in all other\nrespects.\n\n§5 Submission of Contributions\n\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, every Contribution that You have\nintentionally submitted for inclusion in the Subject Matter of the License is\nsubject to this License without any additional terms or conditions applying.\nIrrespective of the above, none of the terms or conditions contained herein may\nbe interpreted to supersede or modify the terms or conditions of any separate\nlicensing agreement that You may have concluded with a Licensor for such\nContributions, such as a so-called \"Contributor License Agreement\" (CLA).\n\n§6 Trademarks\n\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,\nservice marks or product names of the Licensor(s) or of a Contributor.\n\n§7 Limited warranty\n\nThis License is granted free of charge and thus constitutes a gift. Accordingly,\nany warranty is excluded. The Subject Matter of the License is a work in\nprogress; it is constantly being improved by countless Contributors.
