          Grant of Copyright License.
          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
             reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

          Grant of Patent License.
          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
             this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and

             counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
             Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
             to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
             filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual
             employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual
             that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where
             the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
             research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.</p>

               notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
               any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE

         acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
         with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
