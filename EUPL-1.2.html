          Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy
          of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work
          that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following
          the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where
          the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as

          rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion

        Obligations of the Licensee
        <p>
          The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject
          to some restrictions and obligations imposed on
          the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright,
          patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the
          Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
          include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every
          copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee
          must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating
          that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies
          of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or
          Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a
          later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly
          distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by
          communicating &apos;EUPL v. 1.2 only&apos;. The Licensee (becoming Licensor)

          to this Licence. Should the Licensee&apos;s obligations under the
          Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
          Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating

          names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable
          and customary use in describing the origin of the Work

        Disclaimer of Warranty
        <p>
          The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by
          numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore
          contain defects or &apos;bugs&apos; inherent to this type of development.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on

          the Work, including without limitation merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
          accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights
          other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence
          and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

          any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind,
          arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including
          without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
          computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
          damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
          such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory
          product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

          While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
          agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this
          Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your
          own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the
          original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree
          to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
          liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor
          by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.

The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.&#10;&#10;   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, &#39;Compatible Licence&#39; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.&#10;&#10;   Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.&#10;&#10;   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;6.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Chain of Authorship&#10;   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.&#10;&#10;   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.&#10;&#10;   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;7.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty&#10;   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &#39;bugs&#39; inherent to this type of development.&#10;&#10;   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &#39;as is&#39; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.&#10;&#10;   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;8.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Liability&#10;   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;9.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Additional agreements&#10;   While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;10.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Acceptance of the Licence&#10;   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &#39;I agree&#39; placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.&#10;&#10;   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;11.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Information to the public&#10;   In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;12.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Termination of the Licence&#10;   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.&#10;&#10;   Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;13.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous&#10;   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work.&#10;&#10;   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.&#10;&#10;   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.&#10;&#10;   All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;14.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Jurisdiction&#10;   Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;15.&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Applicable Law&#10;   Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat, residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.&#10;Appendix&#10;&#10;&#39;Compatible Licences&#39; according to Article 5 EUPL are:&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; GNU General Public License (GPL) v. 2, v. 3&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v. 3&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Eclipse Public License (EPL) v. 1.0&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; CeCILL v. 2.0, v. 2.1&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Mozilla Public Licence (MPL) v. 2&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL) v. 2.1, v. 3&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike v. 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) for works other than software&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; European Union Public Licence (EUPL) v. 1.1, v. 1.2&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;bullet&quot;;original&#61;&quot;—&quot;;match&#61;&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Québec Free and Open-Source Licence — Reciprocity (LiLiQ-R) or Strong Reciprocity (LiLiQ-R+).&#10;The European Commission may update this Appendix to later versions of the above licences without producing a new version of the EUPL, as long as they provide the rights granted in Article 2 of this Licence and protect the covered Source Code from exclusive appropriation.&#10;&#10;All other changes or additions to this Appendix require the production of a new EUPL version.&#10;&#10;
